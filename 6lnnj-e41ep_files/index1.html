      <p class="ctxtop">I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE my teachers, Buddy Hiles, William Russo, Paul Sills, Easley Blackwood, Viola Spolin, Samuel Lewis, Pir Vilayat Khan, G. S. Sachdev, Terry Riley, Hamza El-Din, and Pandit Pran Nath, for allowing me to define myself and my work through their vision. Pandit Pran Nath, who passed away during the final preparation of this manuscript, has left behind through his recordings and through the voices of his students a golden legacy of transcendant music.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">I give thanks also to my counselors Ben Johnston and Will Johnson for their timely support and pragmatic criticism. Many thanks to my students and friends Bob Fuller, Carol Frick, Jack Leissring, David Balakrishnan, Matthew Goodheart, Connie Coleman, Debra White, and Lori Levy for their grace and grit while I experimented on them—well, <em class="calibre3">through</em> them, perhaps.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">I would like to thank the many people who have helped directly with the production of the book. Marie Carmichael and Francis Martineau read the manuscript and helped make it cogent. Dave Fraser helped develop many of the harmonic models. Kathleen Seidel procured the tapes of Mr. Creel and Dr. Boomsliter, as well as additional texts. Scott Makeig supplied copies of his own work as well as highly stimulating conversation. Marc Savage and Charlie Stevens provided invaluable assistance in compiling an index. And with the most profound generosity, Kirk Whipple supervised the production of over nine hundred musical examples, greatly improving their visual clarity and sustaining the highest standards of craft and musicality. Cory Gray aided us in this project with unflagging spirit, Virginia Cayton helped keep us organized, and Marilyn Morales provided us heartfelt and tactical support.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">The editor of <em class="calibre3">Harmonic Experience,</em> Larry Hamberlin, has been not only its champion but also its fine-tuner, wetnurse, pilot, diplomat, and salesman, as well as its author’s friend, and I thank him profoundly for all of these dimensions. Deep thanks also to Christine Sumner, Virginia Scott, and the staff of Inner Traditions International for their long patience and great resourcefulness.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">And finally, to my three daughters, Athene, Lucy, and Amy, and to my wife, Devi, eternal gratitude.</p>

      <p class="ctxtop">MY WIFE TELLS ME that her adult music students often begin lessons with this request: “I want to play better, of course, but what I’m really hoping to learn is <em class="calibre3">how music works</em>.” The wording may vary—some say they want to learn harmony, others music theory—but the underlying need is the same: A hunger to understand how music exercises its power over our psyches.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">What those students are often surprised to learn is how many professional musicians feel the same hunger. Even after years of university or conservatory training, most musicians still sense that a large piece of musical understanding is missing. Conventional music theory courses have taught them how to label different musical elements, identify chord progressions, and notate what they hear. They may indeed have learned something valuable about how music works, but what remains missing is a clear idea of how their own perceptions and responses fit into the picture.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">The insatiably curious among us begin to search outside the usual sources of instruction to find an answer to that question. In my own journey as a composer and performer, that search has included playing African <em class="calibre3">mbira</em> music, exploring European tuning systems that predate equal temperament, and cracking my skull on the esoteric writings of Pythagorean philosophers. Each of these sources has supplied another piece of the puzzle, but generally I’ve found myself on my own when it came to relating the useful bits and pieces to one another and to the actual music I want to make.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">I had already spent a couple of decades in this search before I crossed paths with W. A. Mathieu, a musician who not only had covered much of the same lonely territory before me but had also managed to synthesize his knowledge into a teachable form. A pianist and composer in both jazz and classical traditions, as well as a longtime student of North Indian singing, Mathieu has developed an approach to self-training in harmony that focuses on the listener’s response to combinations of tones. He takes as his starting point the phenomenon that comes closest to being a universal part of human experience: Our attraction to music that is in tune. That quality of being in tune is called <em class="calibre3">resonance</em>, and just as tones in correct relationships resonate together, so do we, as listeners and performers, resonate along with them. Mathieu shows us how, by singing and playing various combinations of notes in tune, we can learn to observe our changing responses and begin to develop an understanding of music’s power based on what happens in our own bodies and minds.</p>
      <p class="calibre5"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Harmonic Experience</em></b> begins with the fundamental building blocks of music—single tones, sung over a drone—and shows you how to examine in minute detail your own responses to pure resonance. As you gain a conscious appreciation of these responses, a map of music’s inner geography starts to emerge. Once those responses are mapped, the same process of attentive listening and introspection is applied to the impure tunings of equal temperament, which we are able to accept as more or less reasonable facsimiles of the genuine article. The next step, then, is to examine how the ambiguities of equal temperament make possible a harmonic language of exquisite subtlety and beauty.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Such a regimen of careful listening reveals to us not only how music works but also how it works <em class="calibre3">in us</em>. The one prerequisite, beyond the ability to read music, is a willingness to do the practices. Reading the book will put ideas into your head; singing, playing, and listening will put knowledge in your heart.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Mathieu’s approach is at once so simple and so profound that musicians working in any style and at any level can profit from it. Savvy readers may recognize elements of North Indian music theory and jazz theory in addition to orthodox classical ideas. That’s not because his method is some sort of eclectic New Age blend. On the contrary: His theory embraces so many musical traditions because it takes as its starting point the essential physical and psychological facts common to all music. It seems fitting that such a book should appear at a time when many musicians are dissolving the artificial boundaries between musical styles; those musicians will find this book an invaluable tool in the conciliation of opposing views.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">In a time when we are inundated with throwaway books, <em class="calibre3">Harmonic Experience</em> definitely falls in the category of durable goods—a book to return to again and again. The book’s structure resembles a spiraling ascent up a mountain: The same vistas keep coming into view, but from successively higher vantage points. Once the journey has been made, you may choose to revisit parts of the mountain, avoiding the switchbacks and bushwhacking straight up to keep one vista constantly in sight. But any way you journey on this mountain, your relationship with music is certain to be illuminated and enriched by Mathieu’s gentle wisdom.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="ctxtop"><em class="calibre3">HARMONIC EXPERIENCE</em> DESCRIBES THE FULL RANGE of harmony, from its fundamental gestures to its most complex expressions, by means of the unifying principle of resonance. By harmony I mean not simply chord progressions but the relationships of all the notes in a piece both to the keynote and to each other. By resonance I mean those specially reenforcing combinations of tones that in their mutual resounding—their perfect in-tune-ness—evaporate the boundary between music and musician.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">It is generally believed that there are two related but distinct and opposed systems of harmony: an ancient one based on a system of resonances, or “pure” tunings, called just intonation, and a modern one based on the equal division of an octave, but with “impure” tuning, called twelve-tone equal temperament. This book redefines the modern as an evolutionary transformation of the ancient and is allied with a comprehensive revival of ancient values that is already, at the turn of the twenty-first century, well under way.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-9" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Two Reasons for Writing This Book</p>
        <p class="ctx">The chasm between music theory and music practice is immense. The way we <em class="calibre3">think</em> music is so greatly removed from the psychological reasons we <em class="calibre3">do</em> music that theory is more often a hindrance than a help. Students only gradually figure out what most specialists already know in their hearts but are not quick to advertise: there exists no satisfactory general theory of harmony. The central energies that define music are not conscious, much less articulated, in the culture. The universal acceptance of equal temperament in the West has resulted in a splendid body of music, but the accumulated result of centuries of impure, approximate tuning has given our ears a kind of jet lag, a condition of aesthetic depletion. We have no comprehensive music theory today because we are so removed from direct experience of the seed resonances that generated music in the first place. Equal temperament has been something like electric light—highly useful, but alienating us from the basic rhythms of the sun and the moon, the purest phases of being.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It is astounding how thoroughly the resonances of just intonation have been submerged. Entire African villages sing nightlong rituals beautifully in tune, but Americans cannot sing “Happy Birthday” in tune in a restaurant. This raises the deeper issue of our separation from what is natural, and perhaps points to a more complete musical behavior. Maybe, as was thought by Pythagoras, musical harmony really <em class="calibre3">is</em> a model for harmony on a grander scale, and a clear model of our music can teach us something about our present state of separation and loss.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Until the present, just intonation and equal temperament have never been reconciled theoretically. They seem to be two sides of an issue whose adherents are at odds. This book shows how they are a single subject responding to a single theory, that they coevolved and can continue to do so, and that their future together is full of promise. The larger purpose of <em class="calibre3">Harmonic Experience</em>, then, is to bring a complete model of harmony into common practice.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I would like also to mention a more personal reason for writing <em class="calibre3">Harmonic Experience</em>. Ever since I was a teenager attracted to the perfectly tuned jazz chords of the Stan Kenton trombone section, I have wanted to understand harmony as part of my own psyche. During my subsequent apprenticeship to European classical music, however, I could not find—try as I might—the connection between classical theory and the palette of feeling that its music inspires. I need that connection because I do not mimic music easily. To learn music, my intuition needs help: At some point it needs to name the thing it is learning. Only after I have named a thing is my intuition free to take charge. The more I studied the concepts and nomenclatures of music theory, the less it seemed capable of addressing the psychological responses of the listener. Over many subsequent years of studying music that is not in equal-tempered tuning, including Medieval European music, African music, Middle Eastern music, and especially North Indian <em class="calibre3">raga</em>, I came to understand that the link missing from our culture’s classical theory is not so much unknown as forgotten, and that it could be brought forward and described in contemporary terms. As I began to describe this to others, I found I could better describe it for myself. The personal reason for writing this book, then, has been to deepen my own absorption in harmonic language.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-10" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">How This Book Is Organized</p>
        <p class="ctx">The text is divided into four parts.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Part 1 shows how the simplest frequency ratios—perfect fifths and major thirds—are felt as resonances, and how these two resonances combine to organize the system of just intonation. It goes on to describe how a lattice of perfect fifths and major thirds generates most of the world’s musical modes, and asks you, the reader, to be an accomplice in eliciting these modes by singing them. It maintains that bodily understanding is crucial for authentic intellectual mapping, and guides you step by step in comprehending the harmonic relationships implicit in the melodies you sing.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Part 2 shows how the lattice of just intonation serves as the template for our modern system of twelve-tone equal temperament. In the beginning keyboard practices, the twelve tones of equal temperament stand unambiguously for the twelve least-complex tones of the just lattice. The text goes on to demonstrate how, under certain conditions, the twelve tones of the equal-tempered keyboard can stand for more than thirty tones in just intonation.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Part 3 examines in detail the musical responses that allow only twelve tones to stand for more than twelve. First, it shows how a single equal-tempered tone can be made to evoke either of two distinct just tones separated by a very small difference in pitch, called a comma. It then enumerates the behaviors of the various types of commas as they are perceived in equal temperament, thus accounting for all tonal harmony—modal, diatonic, and modulatory—that is available in the modern tuning system.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Part 4 presents a compendium of keyboard practices designed to place the language of tonal harmony simultaneously in the ears, in the intellect, and under the hands. These include diatonic and cadential formulas, tonal modulations, modal modulations, cyclic sequences, and symmetrical harmony. Various notations are offered, the better to visualize the harmonies. Analyses of pieces from the fourteenth to the twentieth centuries show how a resonance-based theory can enrich our understanding of a variety of musics.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are many books that this book is not: it is not a book about counterpoint, or figured bass, or melodic or rhythmic structure, or compositional development, although all of those subjects come into play. It is a harmony book that is meant to reconcile and go beyond, but not supplant, traditional texts.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Method: Art over Science</p>
        <p class="ctx">From ancient times, theorists have tried to rationalize and objectify emotions into abstractions, called <em class="calibre3">affections</em>, that correspond to specific musical elements. In the same way that rhetoric was the systematic art of persuasion, various theories of affections determined how certain modes, rhythms, and melodic figures controlled the emotions of the listener. The relationship of specific musical elements to specific responses is, on one level, obvious: We hear an ascending melody and something within us rises also. But when you examine individual cases, nothing seems able to be pinned down. After all, who decides which responses we are supposed to have? Is there an Affection Police patrolling all listeners: “You there, with the paisley tie—are you properly feeling the anxiety of this augmented second?” The issue lies at the cusp where science and art meet. Science is primarily defined by its objectivity, art by its subjectivity. Are there strategies by which the two can be creatively conjoined?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I approach harmonic theory as an empirical art rather than an aesthetic science. I am led forward by subjective experience, ephemeral feelings of longing and aversion. Learning to hone and keen these, and to trust them, is my work. I can talk numbers and examine the responses of populations, but that will not tell me, finally, what I want to know. What I want to know is my own ear, because it is the only true path to yours.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Inner knowledge of harmony grows with creative use. You hear things, then you use them to construct the world. That is not a very scientific method: it won’t produce repeatable experiments or objective data. As a musician I am fascinated by the objective quantification of experience only to the extent that it will increase my ability to use musical language as a resonator for my life’s portion. Beyond that, the numbers are nonvital curiosities.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In traveling through these pages, I want you to cherish your inner responses, nurse and groom them, learn to believe them. Then, when the numbers shed light on them, fine. But never sacrifice your hearing for a name or a number; there is no music in that direction. True, I will say, “Such-and-such sounds like so-and-so,” and I will describe numbers as having qualities; that is because words and numbers can point the way. But it takes authentic experience—the inside feeling of rightness—to validate concepts. You are the replete knower, and the method of your knowing is the self.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-12" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Learning by Singing</p>
        <p class="ctx">Many if not most musicians in our culture have lost the basic act of singing in tune, the process by which the combinations of tones that organize our hearing and our music are internalized and authenticated. When these harmonic sources have been reclaimed and honored, the particular effects of equal-tempered harmony can be recognized, categorized, and creatively used, as we shall see. It is not enough to listen passively to pure harmonies, or learn to recognize them, or to combine them on an instrument. One has to connect them with one’s feelings by placing them in the body. Sung harmony is embodied intelligence.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In <em class="calibre3">Harmonic Experience</em>, great emphasis is placed on singing over a drone. I want this to sound inviting and not the least bit forbidding, because everyone—no exceptions—is capable of singing perfectly in tune over a drone. The object is not to become a great singer, or a performer of any kind, necessarily. The object is to begin at the source, and then to carry the source resonances with you as you go along.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-13" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">What Is Theory For?</p>
        <p class="ctx">A good thing to remember about music theory is that it typically springs up decades, often centuries, after the birth of the music it describes. A book like this one could simply not have been written during the time its primary subject matter (twelve-tone equal-tempered tonal harmony) was being discovered and developed. The rules of sixteenth-century counterpoint were not definitively codified pedagogically until the eighteenth century (by J. J. Fux, still studied today). The behavior of just intonation itself has been most confusingly and inefficiently articulated by theorists for almost three millennia, right up to the present. And only in the present generation is the code of tonal harmony being cracked, well over a century after its art came into full bloom. Theory is the scat of music, what it leaves behind. Luckily for us, we don’t make music by following rules. We don’t <em class="calibre3">make</em> music at all, so much as find our way in it. Only after the way has been found can the maps be drawn.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">But the maps exist, right alongside the music. And good maps can save you centuries, soldiers, ships, fortunes. The danger: sitting at home hunched over your map table with a fixed grin thinking you’ve been places you haven’t. The balanced way is to study these maps while you cover the territory. By the time you know your way around the territory, the maps will have become torn and faded, and you won’t have to look at them anymore because the territory is teaching you more than the maps ever could.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-14" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Who Is Theory For?</p>
        <p class="ctx">The question cannot help but arise, “Don’t some people get music naturally, without all of the discipline and commitment and analysis?” The answer is yes, some people do and so do you. We all do to some degree. Every action is partly intuitive and partly rational; the proportions change from action to action and from individual to individual. No one is entirely analytical in the process of learning music, and no one is entirely intuitive (although I’ve seen some serious contenders at both extremes). There is even a part of the psyche that actively seeks to <em class="calibre3">not</em> know. It wants sensual saturation and intuitive wholeness, the pure being of childhood, the animal self.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">You have to work out your own recipe for learning, which includes your interaction with this book and the procedures outlined in it. A good guideline to remember is this: the rules of music—including the rules of counterpoint and harmony—were not formed in our brains but in the resonance chambers of our bodies. What feels right and good is what survives. The “rules,” codified over many generations by musicians serving as teachers, arise to protect and disseminate the good vibrations. But every rule and formulation ever made burns away at the moment of music making. Ultimately everyone makes music intuitively; individual circumstances determine the point at which the music rises above the mind and the intuition takes over.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There is a population of musicians who are both intellectually aware and musically whole; at the same time there are millions among us who achieve a high level of musical creativity in a state of musical innocence: The lyrical jazz trumpet player Chet Baker comes to mind. The musically innocent know where they are in the music without possessing a naming language; they have an internal musical map with no proper place-names on it.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">So if half the folks are striving to rise above names and the other half never learned any to begin with, why go about naming everything?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">People name things because transcending knowledge is different from not having any. Intellectual transcendence is not the same as intellectual innocence. A woman who has transcended her intellect and is whole in the moment of music making is a different whole woman than she was when she was musically innocent. The issue is not who has the secret, the intellectually transcendent or the intellectually innocent. The issue is how intellectual or innocent you need to be to find your own musical completion.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The Sufi mystics say, “The mind is the willing slave of the heart.” The key word is <em class="calibre3">willing</em>. The intellect that wills to be in the service of the intuition is powerful and mature—the kind of mind a musician needs in order not to be paralyzed by knowledge. The great fear, especially among singers but among many instrumentalists as well, is that analytical knowledge disables us at our core in the very act of making music. Yet that need not be true. Ideally, an intellectually awake musician is not analyzing while she is performing. She is complete in the moment of pure sound; no thinking is needed. However, she <em class="calibre3">has</em> thought, she <em class="calibre3">has</em> analyzed. The homework has been done, the dues paid, the mental discipline gained. The musical spirit is flying free, but it has been shaped by the work of the mind.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Music theory is not for everyone. I think each person’s mind has a certain capacity for willingly serving his or her heart. Theory should be studied to the limit of that capacity but no more. When you stuff the mind with facts and rules beyond its power to yield, the mental slave rebels and fills the house with mental music, and your heart pines away.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Yet what if your heart is singing fortissimo and your mind is bored to tears?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Then you realize that your mind needs to sing too.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I think you find the balance between heart and mind by asking your heart what it really needs to become musically complete. If the question is clear, your answer will be clear too. Then your mind is finally free to offer service.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-15" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">For Whom This Book Is Written</p>
        <p class="ctx">These pages are looking for musicians within a very wide range of training, including near-beginners who really want to know how harmony works, as well as advanced composers and performers who feel the pinch of traditional concepts and need to redefine music in a whole-making way. Since most people are somewhere in between, let me say that the perfect reader is simply one who wants to know music intimately from the inside out. New paradigms of integrative experience operate at all levels of development: a new way of perceiving old ways can be useful at every stage of learning.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To benefit most fully from this work, however, you must bring to it certain skills. You need to be able to read music. For the last three parts you need to be able to play a keyboard instrument well enough to navigate at least most of the musical examples. It helps to have previously investigated the overtone series, or be ready to (the text helps you). Also, the more you are in the habit of listening to the music of the world’s various cultures, the more insight you will bring to this study.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-16" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">How to Use This Book</p>
        <p class="ctx">I have tried to avoid the typical textbook tone and rhythm. I want to be in the same room with you, talking and showing you what I know so you can hear it for yourself. Then, since you have to <em class="calibre3">do</em> it for yourself, I say, “Now, sing (or play, or write) one of these on your own.” “One of these” will not be a numbered exercise, and there will be no test on Wednesday. But if you take the suggestions for playing and writing as you go along, a new area of harmonic experience will become yours. If you defer too much for too long, your understanding will become increasingly mental and removed—which may be OK for a while. But how long is a while?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A question that always comes up is, “How much time should I spend on this before going on?” A book about harmony needs to be conceived in a more-or-less straight line, with a sensible organization and a cogent train of procedures. But you can’t learn music linearly. Rather, you learn it all at once, a little at a time. You learn it like a ground-glass range finder focuses a distant image: at first everything is a blur, then you barely recognize the scene, then the detail clarifies, and finally everything comes into sharp focus, right down to the leaves. How do you read a book front to back while reading it all at once? You skim, then you read selectively, then you skim some more, settling down like a hawk on different branches of different trees, then up circling again. I suggest that you skim the book first, then peruse passages that seem most interesting, which might mean reading back to front (I, for one, cannot resist reading the end of a book first). Eventually choose a certain part to work your way through experientially, page by page. Sooner or later you will feel the through-line of the book. But—since you could spend your whole life on one page—always keep circling and skimming. Hawks need altitude.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">How many passes can you expect to make over one exercise or paragraph? Perhaps one; perhaps thousands, since the work—especially the work of singing in tune—is never done. Certain singing practices become lifelong companions. When tones are in tune they are not merely vibrant; they seem as if they are separate, individual lives inside your own life, awake and singing inside your mouth. Over the span of years they become like friends whose faces you recognize in the dark.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Another tenacious question is, “How long is this going to take?” The subtext is fear: “I’ll die before I get it,” and images of your brief, unfulfilled career flicker across the screen. There are strategies for dealing with this. One of them is to recognize that you cannot learn faster than you can learn, and to accept that. Another is to realize that each person has his or her own special mixture of advantages and disadvantages. Everyone is an idiot savant in this work, half fast and half slow. Some jazz singers, indelibly in tune, cannot read music or spell chords. I’m a harmony nut who can scarcely waltz. You might give an arm for something of mine that I take for granted, and I might give my teeth for something of yours that you take for granted. My advice is to keep yourself intact and work with what you have.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Thankfully, one eventually learns how not to get bored with the routines of practice. The first evening Adam resides in Eden, let’s say, God makes a gourmet banquet for him, which Adam eats with pleasure.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">“Did you like it?” asks God.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">“Loved it,” says Adam.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The next night Adam comes to supper, looks down at the feast God has prepared, then looks up at God:</p>
        <p class="calibre5">“What? <em class="calibre3">Food</em> again?”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The secret lies in always going deeper into the simplest gestures, appreciating them as gifts instead of burdens.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A related strategy is to let go of any idea you have of yourself as an accomplished master and simply do the work. Whatever is yours to realize will come out of your work, not from a picture you put on your wall. The light around good work is itself achievement and contentment; the rewards of mastery come of their own when the work is true. This advice is easier to give than to follow, but maybe it can help transfer your work energy away from the future and into the present, in the sounding moment where it belongs.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-17" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Tools</p>
        <p class="ctx">I have written two books that you may find useful as preparation or companions for this book: <em class="calibre3">The Listening Book</em> and <em class="calibre3">The Musical Life</em> (refer to the Sources section). The first one discusses listening in general, with emphasis on singing in unison with a single tone. The second contains a detailed, practical section devoted to the production and appreciation of the overtone series (pp. 139–210). In addition, the present book contains a glossary that may be especially useful during the early going, as well as a bibliography for further reading.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">You will also need a tunable instrument capable of producing a sustained drone. Best among these is the tamboura, an instrument made in India, but unless you live near a large coastal city or have contact with musicians from India (or their students), these are difficult to obtain. Drones from reeds are also a good possibility. An accordion, which is beautiful but unwieldy, or a concertina, could work. Indian musicians often use a <em class="calibre3">sruti box</em>, which consists of a few drone reeds activated by a bellows and is much more portable and less expensive than a tamboura. An electronic instrument especially made for producing drones, or an electronic keyboard with a program for just intonation would be OK with the right choice of sound: no vibrato, clean, kind to the ear.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It is also convenient to have a “drone tape.” Such a recording, which provides a continuous hour or so of uninterrupted tonic-and-dominant drone, usually in C, are often distributed privately by teachers of North Indian music. An especially sonorous one played on two huge, gorgeous tambouras is available for twelve dollars (plus appropriate postage) from Kirana-Kahn Music, 304 Devon Drive, San Rafael, California, 94903. Using the piano for a drone is OK but not as satisfactory as any of the above.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Probably the most versatile and available drone instrument is the guitar. Its dronal function is less satisfactory than that of an instrument made especially for the purpose, like a tamboura. But it has the advantage of offering four bass strings that can easily be tuned for a variety of dronal purposes. Many of the practices in part 1 depend on the availability of at least two tunable bass tones, and a guitar is often the most convenient solution. An inexpensive one will work fine; perhaps there is a neglected one near you with your name on it. A harp could also serve well. Instruments from the violin family work less well except in the case of trained musicians who can bow them expertly and effortlessly; their plucked sounds decay too rapidly.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">For the last three parts of the book you will need a decent-sounding piano or electronic keyboard well tuned in conventional equal temperament.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although you can make do nicely with less, the very best solution is to have three instruments: the most pleasing drone instrument you can find (for singing practice), a guitar (for versatility in tuning while learning theory), and a piano (for keyboard harmony).</p>

        <p class="csht">The Teacher Question</p>
        <p class="ctx">Is a living, personal teacher necessary in order to learn harmony? In the largest sense, sound itself is the teacher of sound. A living teacher is always preferable in any transmission, however, and music, which is a human use of sound, is ultimately passed from person to person, from heart to heart. Nonetheless, I want this book to be as far as possible a living paper teacher, a reliable guide through both subject and psyche, so that with its counsel, a few tunable strings, a voice, and a keyboard, you can go as far as you wish on your own.</p>

        <p class="csht">Seeing</p>
        <p class="ctx">Harmony is about the agreement of things with one another. Among musicians, the term <em class="calibre3">harmony</em> usually refers to the way tones relate vertically—stacked up and sounding simultaneously as chords. But a broader musical definition involves the way the ear relates pitches to one another in every dimension, including the agreeableness of an entire piece of music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When the sound waves that reach our ears are evenly spaced—periodic—we perceive the sound as musical: It is a “tone.” If the waves produced by a harp string (for instance) were visible, your eyes would feast on global mandala patterns undulating outward in every direction. But when you crumple a piece of paper, the sound waves that are produced are aperiodic; we call them “noisy.” If you could see those sound waves you would find no pattern in them; they would seem as random as windblown leaves.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What if the air were not only visible but also in slow motion? Imagine you are the size of a pollen grain; imagine as well that time moves at one-thousandth of the speed of human time (it takes the equivalent of ten minutes to nod “yes”) and that the visible waves of air are glowing. The sound of crumpling paper is a moonscape, peaks and canyons scattered every which way. But when the harp string sounds you are inside a theater of dancing lace. Along every line of sight, geometric tessellations are sequencing gracefully through time. <em class="calibre3">Two</em> harp strings sounding together all but overwhelm the senses in a hall of shimmering mirrors. Now call yourself back to human dimensions. A harp string sounds; you say, “Harp.” Two strings together: “Nice.” The amazing thing is that the human ear does experience these almost unbearably beautiful displays simply as tone and the harmony between tones.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To get a fix on the nature of these patterns, let’s consider some simple kinds of periodic motion. Motion moves through time, and we love our time periodic: We respond to the seasons, to the intrinsic polarity of summer and winter. Breath comes in and goes out, waves move up and down and back and forth in peaks and troughs; we walk left and right; we drum<em class="calibre3"> boom</em> and <em class="calibre3">chick</em> in the everlasting holy backbeat. Of course we love other kinds of time too: the randomness of rain has its place. But to the human body, chaotic motion can all too easily become spastic motion; we prefer the periodicities of the dance.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The conscious appreciation of simple periodic motion in everyday life is a kind of musical practice, the care and feeding of a primary musical sensibility. To the ear, simple periodicity is the littlest brick needed to build a music mansion. By sensitizing ourselves to it we become like a builder who, by experiencing the essence of a brick, can envision a building.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-22" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Touching</p>
        <p class="ctx">It would be fascinating to examine our responses to simple sound waves, but we cannot hear them in pure form. Although we can scrutinize the behavior of periodic waves, called sine waves, in the macroworld of jump ropes and pendulums, in the world of audible sound the naked sine wave is denied us. Why? Because waves make waves. A pebble dropped in a puddle makes ever smaller, ever finer waves. The same is true within the chambers and fluids of the ear. The very act of hearing even a simple thing involves complex waves-within-waves. Furthermore, vibrating bodies themselves do not vibrate as a single entity only; they split themselves up into many parts, each of which produces its own characteristic sine wave; in musical tone these are called overtones. If a sounding body has a sufficiently simple shape (a long string with a constant diameter, for instance) the many resulting overtones are related to one another in simple ways that we call harmonic and recognize as harmonious.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Overtones relate to the tone that generates them, and to each other, with various degrees of complexity. Generally speaking, the simpler the vibrational pattern the more we tend to term it “consonant”; the more complex the pattern, the more we use the term “dissonant.” In the everyday world we can distinguish between a marching band, a riotous mob, and the many stages in between. But in the microworld of the ear and brain, the discriminations of musical harmony are effected in a realm almost too small and too fast to conceptualize. Almost, but not quite.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In describing the qualities of consonance and dissonance we usually use the sense of touch as an analogy: Certain harmonic combinations are smooth, others are rough. But I think the sense of touch is more than an analogy. Quite literally, music touches us.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A plucked harp string vibrates the air; the air vibrates the eardrum, which vibrates the tiny bones attached to it; these vibrate the fluid in the snail-wound cochlea of the inner ear. If the cochlea were stretched out straight, the basilar membrane, a kind of inner skin, would be seen to run the length of it. Up through this skin sprout thousands of the finest hairs. The vibrating fluid in the cochlea vibrates the basilar membrane, which vibrates its hairs, sending electrical pulses to the brain, where, by the greatest miracle of all, the pulses become our consciousness of a harp string. To experience sound with the same sensibility that your fingers experience the smooth and rough surfaces of the touchable world, try to feel the surface of your basilar membrane being excited as you listen to an ear-catching sound: a harp string, for instance, or a more everyday sound like birdsong or a whistling tea kettle.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Seem impossible? Maybe, maybe not. Perhaps we cannot reach that far inside. But a clear picture of the chain of energy transformations connecting a sound source in the outer world to a receiving station in the brain may help in imagining how sound touches our innermost skin.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Numbering</p>
        <p class="ctx">All this talk of seeing air and touching sound is meant, of course, to increase your range of perception; the simplest facts of musical life can never be too vividly envisioned or deeply felt. But there is also another mode of perception: number.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When we study acoustics in books, the subject looks indeed like a swarm of numbers. Once we realize that the numbers stand for actual auditory experience, however, a new perception comes in: We are in awe of an ear that navigates by innate intelligence the unimaginably complex territory of periodic vibration. The numbers are there to help make the unimaginable imaginable. We can be just as stimulated by numbers as we are by images and sensations.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Because you can’t put everything into one book, this book must assume that you have learned enough about the overtone series to recognize it. (If you haven’t, try some of the sources listed in the back of the book.) But for reference, example 1.1 is a chart of the overtone series based on C. Reading from the bottom to the top, it includes:</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li class="calibre10">The letter names of the first five overtones of C</li>
          <li class="calibre10">The staff notation of the tones</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Their frequencies, assuming that C vibrates 128 cycles per second (the frequency of C is actually 130.8 at standard concert pitch)</li>
          <li class="calibre10">The frequency ratios of the overtones to the generating tone (C)</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Their frequency ratios if the generating tone is called <em class="calibre3">x</em></li>
          <li class="calibre10">The scientific name (the generating tone is called the <em class="calibre3">first partial</em>)</li>
          <li class="calibre10">The names in common usage (<em class="calibre3">harmonics</em> or <em class="calibre3">overtones</em>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="calibre5">Sooner than later you will need to be able to conceptualize the overtone series immediately from any pitch, so this is a good time to learn it as the keyboard chord shown in example 1.2.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Even though the piano is not conventionally tuned precisely to the overtone series (as we will discuss in part 2), it is extremely valuable at this stage to learn to transpose this overtone chord at the keyboard chromatically. For the time being, think in terms of the spellings shown in example 1.3, which you should practice both ascending and descending.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">As we shall see, it is not sufficient to know, for instance, that the fifth partial of A is C<span class="fon">#</span>; you need also to be instantly clear that C<span class="fon">#</span> is the fifth partial of A. You need to know which overtone series a given pitch is part of. This will come more easily if you can put your hands on the overtone chords of each pitch.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Our work in part 1 of this book is to enter the heart of the harmony implicit in the overtone series, to pass conscious time there, and to grow gradually accustomed to the light it gives.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Grasp two wooden pencils, one in each hand, eraser ends away from you, as if 
they were drum mallets. Against the edge of a shelf or desk, strike the circular 
metal bands that hold the erasers so that each sound is crisp and clear. Now, 
striking both pencils simultaneously, try to synchronize your two hands so well 
that you hear only one sound. You will need lots of skill or luck to do so 
repeatedly. Typically there will be two sounds separated from one another by 
anywhere from <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">10</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> to <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">1,000</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> of a second, much like the click of a camera shutter. The word <em class="calibre3">click</em> itself might sharpen your ears: notice the doubleness of the initial hard <em class="calibre3">c</em> followed (after <em class="calibre3">li</em>) by the <em class="calibre3">ck</em>. A single sound would be closer to <em class="calibre3">kih</em>, or simply an aspirated <em class="calibre3">k</em> without the vowel. Try to make the two pencils go <em class="calibre3">k</em>, not <em class="calibre3">click</em>. Now do this in tempo, about one attempt per second. Strangely elusive, no?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now for a more musical experiment. Set a metronome (an electronic one is preferable) at sixty beats per minute and try to synchronize the tapping of one pencil to it. Partly because of the clean sound of the metronome, the discrepancy between you and it will now be more clear. If you experiment at faster tempi you may notice that you can become entrained in a metric “groove” for a few beats; but soon you will stray to the early or the late side, then come to dead center again. This gradual, barely perceptible straying on either side of the tempo is often desirable in music, and good musicians can control it. In jazz it is a factor in groove aesthetics; in classical music it is one of the conditions of phrasing called <em class="calibre3">rubato</em>, which means “robbed”—in this context, continually robbing and paying back.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In the rapid-fire world of tone, where instead of a few strokes per second there are typically a few hundred cycles per second, the groove of entrainment produces the euphoric resonance of a true unison. Speeding and slowing (raising and lowering) of the true pitch a few times per second is called vibrato, and it is beautiful in the degree that it is intentional on the part of the musician, just as the speeding and slowing of the tempo of a piece is musical only to the degree that it is intentional.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The object of our pencil-and-metronome research is to examine more closely the experience of the groove of metric entrainment. It can be a frustrating experience, but it can also be compelling and uplifting. The word <em class="calibre3">yoga</em> is from Sanskrit; it means “to join,” as a yoke joins and unifies the energies of two oxen. A little bit of metronome yoga is good for us; it allows us to experience in the measurable, countable realm of metric time what happens in the tonal world when we try to sing in unison with a string. A musical unison is nothing less than a metric groove, but faster—too fast to count, but not too fast for the ear to register as pitch. If our voices vibrate too slowly, our pitch is flat; too quickly, then we are sharp; just right, and we say, “Ah!”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What is this <em class="calibre3">ah</em>? What energies join in union? Maybe it is the will of the singer with the energy of matter. You <em class="calibre3">will</em> yourself in tune with the string. Your intention drives your voice, and as the union becomes real you say <em class="calibre3">ah</em>. When your unison with a string is true, you seem to merge into it, to disappear, and all your fantasies and financial statements disappear too, at least for a breath.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To learn how musical harmony behaves, it is crucial to clarify and retain this image of <em class="calibre3">one</em> vibration of a something per <em class="calibre3">one</em> vibration of something else, and to associate that image with your experience of singing the unison. The “one to one” of two things vibrating in unison is written 1:1. The difficulty at this point in the discussion is that the concept seems too simple. You nod and say, “Sure, of course.” But the more complex ratios, like 3:2 and 16:9 (which will soon be introduced) all derive from the same basic process: <em class="calibre3">x</em> of these per <em class="calibre3">y</em> of those. So your internal picture of 1:1 can never be too vivid, nor your experience of it too deep.</p>

        <p class="csht">Singing <em class="calibre3">Sa</em></p>
        <p class="ctx">Singing unison with a drone is such an intrinsic aspect of learning North Indian classical music—possibly the most pitch-sensitive music in the world—that serious students practice it with conscious devotion over many years. The first degree of a scale, which in European solfege is called <em class="calibre3">do</em>, in Sanskrit is called <em class="calibre3">sa</em>. I suggest using <em class="calibre3">sa</em> because it sings so well. The following description of singing in unison with a drone is adapted from <em class="calibre3">The Listening Book</em> (pp. 139–40).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Find a note you can sing comfortably, not too low. This generally falls around C, B, or A. Find a drone string (piano, guitar, harp, tamboura, etc.) or reed (organ, accordion, sruti box, etc.) that produces a full tone at your chosen pitch. You can sing sitting on a chair, or cross-legged on the floor, or standing, or in any comfortable position. Find your breath and even it out. Relax your jaw, stretch your spine a little. Get hollow. Sound the drone and listen for a full minute. Listening is the key. Let the expansiveness of the drone’s sound, even if it is soft, fill you up. Take an ample breath and, using <em class="calibre3">sa</em> with the vowel wide open, sing the drone’s pitch <em class="calibre3">within</em> the sound of the drone.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The idea is to sing and listen at the same time, with equal energy: receptively and expressively balanced. To perfect that balance, to own it and identify with it, is the essence of music practice. Each <em class="calibre3">sa</em> is a chance to go up on point and make a controlled turn. On each breath, inside meets outside; sea meets shore. Find the rhythm of your breath and repeat the pitch with increasing awareness.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Some practical hints:</p>
        <p class="blockht">The less vibrato the better.</p>
        <p class="blockh">The notes should be not too long, not too short.</p>
        <p class="blockh">Let your breath determine the length of the notes, one breath per note.</p>
        <p class="blockh">Let the back of your tongue fall into the back of the throat naturally.</p>
        <p class="blockh">Try to begin each note at the <em class="calibre3">exact</em> pitch of the drone; don’t slide up to pitch like a motor revving up.</p>
        <p class="blockh">Give yourself a limit, and no further: Two minutes? Eleven breaths? Twenty-one breaths? Maybe three today.</p>
        <p class="blockh">Keep track on your fingers, not in your mind.</p>

        <p class="csht">Simplicity</p>
        <p class="ctx">There is a relationship between mastery and simplicity. The greater the mastery one has in a subject, the more absorbed one can become in its most fundamental concepts and behaviors. Conversely, a beginner usually needs to skim the surface before being drawn in. A child is much more likely to be interested in learning “Greensleeves” or current pop music than she is in learning how to sing in unison with a string, or in recognizing the overtone series. It is natural to want to do something musical right away. But as you develop, you begin to hunger for what is beneath the surface, for the practices and concepts that deepen and widen your range of perception. Gradually, your capacity for elementary practice increases, and you find yourself moving slowly and listening deeply for the mere pleasure of it. Don’t be too surprised or chagrined if at first you become easily bored singing unisons or doing the other practices in part 1 of this book. You need to practice only long enough to draw something from the moment. But keep coming back to the simple things. It may come to pass that what was once mildly interesting and marginally relevant has become a touchstone for your musical life.</p>

        <p class="ctx">The next most complex integer after one is two. The ratio 1:1 is a unison. The ratio 2:1 is an octave. In the metric realm, 2:1 is two taps to one tap, or eighth notes to quarter notes, as shown in figure 3.1.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Exquisitely simple as 2:1 is, it is not a no-brainer; it requires discrimination. True, our bilateral form helps us along intuitively, not to mention the intrinsic duple nature of the up-and-down bounce of balls and the back-and-forth swing of pendulums. But it still takes a special state of consciousness to clap your hands twice as fast as you tap your foot. And even though the frequencies of a sung tone are too fast to count, we are able to sing octaves just as certainly as we are able to clap 2:1. This capability is peculiar to humans. You might get two dogs to sing at once, but not in octaves. Nor can infant humans discriminate octaves, though they learn to, often by age two and usually by age five. When grown men and women sing together they sing in octaves spontaneously. It is this special human capacity for learning that has enabled us to develop the labrynthine harmonic structures of our music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To experience the nature of this specialness, try pretending that you are learning to clap 2:1 for the very first time in your life. How old do you think you might have been when you first clapped 2:1 with someone? How much more difficult is it, exactly, for a child to learn to clap 2:1 than to clap 1:1? How much more difficult is it to sing an octave than a unison? People who think they are tone deaf (no one is) find out that after they learn to sing unisons, octaves are the next hurdle to cross.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Try singing a perfect octave above your drone while grasping the quality of 2:1 consciousness in the mind of the ear.</p>

        <p class="csht">Nomenclature: Octave versus 2:1</p>
        <p class="ctx">The following paragraphs are adapted from <em class="calibre3">The Musical Life</em> (p. 164).</p>
        <p class="blockp"><em class="calibre3">Octave</em> means eight, as in <em class="calibre3">octopus, octagon</em>, and <em class="calibre3">October</em> (which was originally the eighth month). A musical scale can be seen as a ladder; in our culture there are seven distinct rungs in that ladder—seven scale tones—before the eighth tone of “starting over again” occurs. Culturally, Westerners prefer these seven-rung ladders. But other cultures prefer five rungs in their ladders, so in those cultures, the scale “starts over” on the sixth note; an “octave” would be the sixth note, and could be called a “sixth.” Some twentieth-century music divides the musical ladder into twelve equally spaced rungs; in that twelve-tone system, the scale “starts over” on the thirteenth note; in this case an “octave” could justifiably be called a “thirteenth.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Regardless of how many rungs are on their musical ladders, all human ears recognize the doubled frequency as the place for starting over, but our word <em class="calibre3">octave</em> is culture-bound, appropriate to the music we Westerners are most familiar with. “Twice-as-fast” or “2:1” is the proportionate—or harmonic—name for the “starting over” effect, which is common to all people.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">So is an octave a “two” or an “eight?” It is clear that the harmonic name, <em class="calibre3">2:1</em> (based on frequency ratio), and the interval name, <em class="calibre3">octave</em> (based on scale steps), refer to different aspects of the same thing. The distinction between the names does not seem terribly problematic in this simple case. But in more complex cases the competing nomenclatures create a murk so obfuscating that entire theory classes have been known to return home to mother. Again from <em class="calibre3">The Musical Life</em> (p. 190):</p>
        <p class="blockp">Even well-schooled musicians have rarely clarified this apparent contradiction for themselves. Distinctions between melody and harmony are typically ignored. So prevalent are the easier, melodic concepts of distance that the term <em class="calibre3">interval</em> has taken over musical thinking and practice, much to the detriment of both. Most people learn their way around the musical landscape by measuring the melodic distances only, by interval; and they think this describes what is going on. It is as if you asked someone, “How ya doin’?” and instead of hearing, “My girlfriend came back and I’m soaring,” or “The rain is getting me down,” you hear, “Seventeen feet from that rock over there, and six inches from your nose.” Too bad, because clarity about the relationship between harmonic and melodic space is precisely what our music once had and has now lost.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Do your best to clarify the difference between the <em class="calibre3">ratio</em> of 2:1 and the <em class="calibre3">interval</em> of the perfect octave—between the harmonic name and the melodic name—now, while the going is still relatively easy.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Threefold symmetry has always puzzled and absorbed the bicameral mind. I recall learning to waltz as a young child and having trouble toughing it out all the way to the third beat; even now I have difficulty detaching my body sufficiently from its bilateral symmetry to waltz without feeling one of the beats as extra. I remember the failures, so I don’t take the apparent simplicity of a three-to-one for granted. The complexity that occurs immediately beyond duality is not obvious.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">For the same reason that the second partial is called an octave, the third partial is called a twelfth (i.e., up the scale an octave, then four more notes). It can be closely approximated on the piano, as in example 4.1.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although any in-tune piano will give some sense of the quality of the relationship of the fundamental to its tripling, it is much more purely produced as the third partial of a guitar string, as follows:<sup class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-490" class="calibre12"></a><a href="#calibre_link-392" class="calibre12">*1</a></sup></p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li class="calibre13">To be consistent with the nomenclature of this book, tune the D string down a whole tone to C.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">Lay the guitar face up on the floor or on a table, keeping the fretboard on your left.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">Lightly place your left index finger exactly one-third of the way along the newly tuned string (over the seventh fret).</li>
          <li class="calibre13">With a pick or your right index finger, pluck the string vigorously near the bridge of the guitar while leaving your left index finger in place.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">A half second after the pluck, take your left finger away. The third partial G will ring out.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">The longer you leave your left finger lightly in place, the more you will damp the generating tone, so with practice you can balance the loudness of the overtone G and the generating tone C as you please.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="calibre5">Unlike the fundamental and its doubling, the fundamental and its tripling sound essentially different from one another—at least more different than the same. There is an energy in their combination that is not in a unison or an octave, some new feeling imparted by this waltzing in the tone world. This perception is worldwide: Cultures that name scale tones assign identical or similar names to octaves (tenor C and alto C) but different names to twelfths (tenor C and alto G). The two tones C and G clearly belong together: They are placidly, eternally, and utterly consonant. But they are different specifically in that we do not perceive the musical scale as beginning again at the twelfth tone. We have gone past “starting over” into something new. As we shall see, this newness grows new newness, and gradually a musical structure of tones is built.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre1"><p class="csht">Octave Reduction</p><p class="ctx">In order to proceed we need to consider a few practical matters. First, two tones separated by more than an octave are often treated as if they were within the same octave. Hence a twelfth becomes a fifth (i.e., we throw out the bottom seven notes and start counting from what was the eighth, or octave). Two octaves and a third becomes, simply, a third. Getting rid of the unwanted octaves is called <em class="calibre3">octave reduction</em> and allows the relationships we are examining to be more easily sung. Although it might make a purist nervous, this process adroitly turns harmonic theory into melodic practice, because in actual music, melodies typically move by intervals smaller than an octave.</p><p class="calibre5">To experience the real difference between a twelfth and a fifth, consider for a moment the purist’s view. The first three tones of the harmonic series are shown in example 4.2. First sing a twelfth, 3:1, above the drone. Then play the drone an octave higher and sing the same note, which now forms a fifth, 3:2, with the drone. (Do this at the piano if your usual drone instrument doesn’t allow this octave switch easily.)</p><p class="img"><img src="000009.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><em class="calibre3"><b class="calibre8">Example 4.2</b></em></p><p class="img"><img src="000010.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"> <b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 4.2</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">In the macroworld, 3:1 (figure 4.2) is easily played. The more complex rhythm 3:2 (shown in figure 4.3) is also easily played if you know how, but you have to learn how. When you carefully balance the triple and duple elements, the result is neither a waltz nor a march, but a cross-rhythm, and it can be enormously beguiling. It seems to have some witchcraft in it, a kind of floating magic.</p><p class="img"><img src="000011.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 4.3</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Figure 4.4 shows how to practice three against two.</p><p class="img"><img src="000012.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 4.4</em></b></p>
<p class="ctx">The meter of the combined rhythm varies, depending on your accent. If you accent the left hand, then the 
<span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> meter predominates; if you accent the right hand, <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">6</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="numerator">8</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> predominates. Practice this until you can hear either meter at will and finally both equally. A new experience arises that is the result of both rhythmic feelings occurring simultaneously.</p></div>
      <div id="calibre_link-34" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Rhythmic 3:2 versus the Harmonic 3:2</p>
        <p class="ctx">Imagine that you are, in addition to your normal-sized self, a very small person stationed at the surface of your own eardrum. As your large self is singing 3:2 with a drone, your small self is being choreographed by a cross-rhythm trampoline. What the ears of your large self hear is a familiar perfect fifth. “Oh, that,” you say, while your small self is wildly dancing away. How to experientially connect the consonance of the perfect fifth with the physicality of the cross-rhythm?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Some composers have tried to make the connection by electronically doubling the speed of the cross-rhythm until it turns into audible pitches, and then precisely matching up the rhythm with the harmony it generated. But I suspect there is a perceptual canyon between rhythm and pitch we do not cross. The sense of pitch itself may be a breakdown in the ear’s ability to process pulses as they become too rapid to perceive individually, much the same way that still images following one another more and more rapidly confound the eye and become, at a critical speed, a movie. “As above, so below” has its conditions: Certain dimensions are indeed similar between higher and lower orders; others change form. What we need to do now is plumb the numbers in our minds and wholly absorb the harmonies in our bodies and accept the mystery as nature presents it: When the numbers two and three get married, they produce harmonic and rhythmic offspring that, even if they don’t look much like siblings, nevertheless do have the same parents.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We can now see just how much more complex 3:2 is than 3:1. In the process of octave reduction we accept the added richness of the complex version on the assumption that it does not alter the essential harmony of the simple version but merely presents it in a more usable form. Although in the practical world we accept the two versions as virtually equivalent, for the sake of a deeper understanding, be sure to appreciate the hierarchical difference between 3:1 and 3:2.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-35" class="calibre1"><p class="csht">Nomenclature: Reading versus Singing</p><p class="ctx">One of the confusions of our musical nomenclature stems from the fact that we conventionally sing scales <em class="calibre3">up</em> and read text <em class="calibre3">down</em>. As children we learn our <em class="calibre3">do</em>, <em class="calibre3">re</em>, <em class="calibre3">mi</em> and count our scale degrees from the bottom up: A perfect fifth is the fifth scale degree up from the bottom. But we learn to read words from the top down:</p><p class="img"><img src="000013.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="p">    Likewise, we read fractions from the top down: <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> means “three over four” or “three quarters” or, in music, “three-quarter time,” not “four under three,” and so on. In terms of our present discussion, consequently, one says not only that the interval of five scale degrees from C up to G is a “perfect fifth” but also that the 3:2 ratio G makes with the C below it is a “three-to-two ratio.” The full, maddening sentence is, “A perfect fifth is three to two,” meaning that the interval of a fifth (counting up) stands as the proportion 3:2 (counting down).</p><p class="calibre5">Just as the distinction between the scalar name <em class="calibre3">octave</em> and the harmonic name <em class="calibre3">2:1</em> has been clarified in chapter 3, so also the various names for the third partial must now be reviewed and entirely understood.</p><p class="calibre5">The third partial is 3:1 harmonically, and it is also the twelfth scale degree above the fundamental. By octave reduction, 3:1 becomes 3:2, as in example 4.3.</p><p class="img"><img src="000014.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 4.3</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Likewise, a scalar twelfth becomes a scalar fifth, as in example 4.4.</p><p class="img"><img src="000015.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 4.4</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Thus, <em class="calibre3">a scalar fifth is harmonically 3:2</em>. Truly realize this, or the eyes are guaranteed soon to glaze. You must be satisfied in your mind that the numbers five and three are being used to measure different dimensions of the same thing.

The answer is “scalar distance and harmonic ratio.” (This opens the larger question, “Why is scalar space additive and harmonic space multiplicative?” which is a question I cannot answer.)</p></div>

        <p class="csht">Pentamerous Nature</p>
        <p class="ctx">Five is the next prime number after three. Just as three is an entire world more than two, five opens a new, “prime” realm of experience not definable by anything previous to it. Human thought is permeated with the five mystery. There are five elements—earth, air, fire, water, and the fifth, quintessence, the spirit of all the others. There are five directions—north, south, east, west, and center. A true five is a pentacle, a pentagon, a five-pointed star. Cut an apple or a quince through its equator and examine the fivefold symmetry of the seed cavity. Let your eye be drawn into a five-petaled wildflower. In pentamerous nature, the stability and purity of triple nature has been filled in by a fullness we can feel.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Johannes Kepler said that you can account for the nature of fruit blossoms not only by contemplation of their beauty but also by contemplation of the number five, which characterizes the soul of these plants. “The fruit from a pentamerous blossom becomes fleshy, as in apples and pears, or pulpy, as in roses and cucumbers, the seed concealed inside the flesh or pulp.” He emphasizes the especially fecund quality of five by noting that from a hexamerous (six-sided) blossom “nothing is born except a seed in a dry cavity.”<sup class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-491" class="calibre12"></a><a href="#calibre_link-394" class="calibre12">*2</a></sup></p>
        <p class="calibre5">One way of invoking pentangularity is to try to draw a pentagon with equal sides and angles, or trace one in the air. It is revealingly difficult. But to become truly grounded in pentamerous nature, we need to beat time. Most of what is <em class="calibre3">called</em> five in the metric world is not a true five, but an alternation between the lower primes, three and two. Fortunately, the perfect investigative tools are at our disposal: five-fingered hands. Try tapping on a tabletop, one finger after the other, calling your thumb one, and the succeeding fingers two, three, four, and five, counting smoothly and evenly and not pausing between five and the next one. Be sure not to emphasize the three (one-two-<em class="calibre3">three</em>-four-five) or the four (one-two-three-<em class="calibre3">four</em>-five). This is neither easy nor obvious, but if you stay with it you can feel your pentamerous self emerging.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">More accessible and accurate, but slightly diluted, is the practice of walking while using your fingers to number your steps one through five. As you get into the feeling of your walk, five nature will take over. I say “slightly diluted” because this is really ten nature. Every other <em class="calibre3">one</em> will be on an alternate foot, and ten steps are needed for the five-times-two cycle to come around. All in all, though, this is the best way to feel convincingly pentamerous. A refinement: slightly flex each finger in turn as you step, without even thinking number names.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The ancient cross-rhythm between two (legs) and five (fingers), still common in India and the Middle East, is less obvious in cultures dependent on wheels (not legs) and calculators (not fingers). It is a lost world worth reviving because it is both elevating and reassuring. It keeps you spinning but grounds you before you spin away.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As for musical harmony, pentamerous nature generates in us deep and often elaborate responses. As usual, singing against a drone is the surest method for realizing this. If you can, find a trusted string that produces Great C, which is two octaves below middle C. The low string of a large tamboura is ideal if rare; a pedal harp Great C is also excellent. The lowest string of a guitar tuned down a third from E to C is OK, as is the Great C of an organ, electronic or otherwise. Beware the Great C of a piano—it is not so great for this purpose, unless you listen very selectively. The extreme tension under which piano strings are strung render their overtones progressively sharper as their partial numbers increase (this is called the <em class="calibre3">inharmonicity</em> of the string). So you can use the piano Great C only if you strike it very softly and trust your vocal intuition more than you trust the fifth partial sounding off the string, which will be mildly sharp.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If you are able to find the right Great C string, sound it, listen to it, and then sing its fifth partial (two octaves and a third higher), quietly mixing your note with the bass. Men can sing this note in falsetto if it is more comfortable. If you can, induce the fifth partial and let it guide your voice. (On the guitar, its appropriate node—for touching lightly as you pluck the string—is just shy of the fifth fret.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If none of the above strategies seem to work, transpose the exercise in any way so that your voice comfortably rests two octaves and a major third above a supportive drone. Less good, but still useful, is to reduce by one octave so that you sing a major tenth above tenor C. Whatever your arrangement, keep in mind that it is ultimately a state of resonance—a kind of shelf of certainty—more than it is a sharpening or flattening of pitch that you will come to recognize as the experience of being “in tune.” It is more a sympathy than a measurement of distance, a quality rather than a quantity. There is not enough paper in the universe to say this enough times.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Use the <em class="calibre3">sargam</em> syllable <em class="calibre3">ga.</em> Feel the current of your air column streaming against the back ridge of your soft palate. Sing softly, with no vibrato, until your voice seems to come out of the fundamental in the same effortless way the fifth partial does. Blend into the drone almost to the point of disappearing entirely, with no worries about coming back.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It may be that the sound of a pure third requires a subtle shift in your listening, and there may be a good reason. The kind of major third you are used to hearing from an equal tempered piano keyboard is about one-seventh of a semitone sharper than the fifth partial. That is quite an audible difference, and your piano ears may guide you into singing a bit sharp. Again, remember that it is primarily a resonance you are seeking rather than a pitch. Listen more to the drone than to your voice; the drone knows the answer and will tell you if you listen. After you practice this a few times you will hear and feel the rightness in it.</p>

It is historically true that our culture has gradually—although conditionally—traded the beauty of just intonation for another beauty, perhaps commensurate: the pleasure of modulation through many keys within a given piece. In our modern tuning system, the deep, smooth pleasure of pentamerous harmony especially is sensibly compromised. The resultant sharpness of the major thirds is not enough to drive you crazy, but it is enough to make you restless, which is one of the reasons our music is restless. To compensate for this (and here is the “condition” of the trade mentioned above) when the harmony calms down and stays close to the tonic, sensitive singers and players of variable-pitch instruments adjust their pentamerous harmonies to agree with their innate pentamerous nature, and thus our ancient, patient ears are recompensed.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What actually happens to you when you experience the full beauty of just intonation—especially the richness of pure thirds—is that the exquisite finery of equal temperament becomes all the more mysterious and compelling. Ultimately, you come to understand precisely what equal temperament does that just intonation cannot do. Our aim is to heighten the appreciation of both tunings, and the real beginning is here in the task before us: living some long moments in the consonance of pentamerous harmony.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Whatever you do, don’t try to get pentamerous religion by striking C and E together on the piano. Get it by letting the fifth partial guide your singing. As with duple and triple harmony, quintuple harmony is made real by understanding slow-motion experience (walking and beating rhythms), by internalizing the vibrational experience (listening and singing) and by the little darting leaps we make between these different ways of knowing.</p>

guide to singing, it is time to examine the octave reduction that allows 5:1 to 
become 5:4, or in the rhythmic world, figure 5.1 to become figure 5.2.</p><p class="img"><img src="000018.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 5.1</em></b></p><p class="img"><img src="000019.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 5.2</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">In chapter 4 we saw how even though 3:2 is substantially more complex than 3:1 in the rhythmic world, the two ratios are nonetheless heard as having the same harmonic essence. We now will apply the same method to pentamerous harmony. For reference, example 5.1 shows again the overtone series.</p><p class="img"><img src="000020.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 5.1</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Study the progressively more complex relationships shown in example 5.2.</p><p class="img"><img src="000021.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 5.2</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">If you thought 3:2 was a problematic cross-rhythm, 5:2 will be no easier. 5:4 is truly difficult, so much so, in fact, that one rarely hears it performed, apart from a few African drummers, fewer Indian tabla players, and specialists in twentieth-century concert music of the West. Contrast this with the fact that nearly everyone in every culture—most of the billions of us—has found 5:4 in the harmonic world to be a natural and intuitive musical given. 5:4 is an extremely rare rhythm yet an extremely common harmony. Our bilaterally symmetric, gravity-conditioned bodies do not easily cast off the duple dimension. For a dancer, 5:1 (five arm motions for one leg motion, for instance) is possible and perhaps beautiful, but 5:4 is extremely rare by virtue of its difficulty. Dancers simply don’t <em class="calibre3">do</em> the rhythmic equivalent of octave reduction; that is, they don’t transform 5:1 into 5:4. The aural brain, on the other hand, somehow minimizes, to a substantial degree, the effect of the duple dimension; in the harmonic world it reduces octaves effortlessly and with little change of meaning.</p>
<p class="p">    For those interested in learning the cross-rhythm 5:4 it is best to first practice, in one hand only, the straightforward rhythm in <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">5</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> time shown in figure 5.3. Placing that rhythm in two hands as shown in figure 5.4 results in the right hand playing five beats while the left hand plays four.</p><p class="img"><img src="000022.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><em class="calibre3"><b class="calibre8">Figure 5.3</b></em></p><p class="img"><img src="000023.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><em class="calibre3"><b class="calibre8">Figure 5.4</b></em></p><p class="calibre5">Perhaps, for a student of harmony, it may be enough to appreciate that 5:4 feels relatively complex to us and leave it at that. After all, the harmonic ratios are certain to become even more complex as we proceed, and we must be prepared to lose track of their rhythmic equivalents sooner or later. We surely will never make a viable cross-rhythm out of 16:15, which is a garden variety semitone in just intonation. Nevertheless, for the obsessive among us (count me in), 5:4 may not prove too difficult to learn after all, and might even prove musically useful. “Learning music is the art of turning the seemingly impossible into the familiar,” said Easley Blackwood to me more than once.</p><p class="calibre5">If you can beat 5:4 fluently, do you have a better understanding of a pure third? A better <em class="calibre3">understanding,</em> yes. A deeper <em class="calibre3">experience</em>? You have to find that one out for yourself, gentle musician, and when you do, send me a postcard.</p></div>

A piece of music starting on C and containing only doublings (or halvings) would have only C’s in it. You can find every C on a piano and play octave music, like a kid who has just discovered that there are eight C’s on a piano <em class="calibre3">and here they all are.</em> It’s an eerie piece. The stack of octaves stands like the floors and ceilings of an empty building, an outline with nothing filled in.

        <p class="csht">The Powers of Three as Generative: Compounding</p>
        <p class="ctx">The powers of three are different; from them have come penetrating metaphors for our inner life of thought and spirit. Lao-tzu, around 600 B.C.E., wrote, “One has produced Two, Two has produced Three.” A commentator explains, “These words mean that One has been divided into Yin, the female principle, and Yang, the male principle. These two have joined, and out of their junction has come a third, Harmony. The spirit of Harmony, as it condenses, produces all beings.”<sup class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-492" class="calibre12"></a><a href="#calibre_link-396" class="calibre12">*3</a></sup></p>
        <p class="calibre5">In music we can observe how the third partial of C begets a new note, G (3:1). In turn, the third partial of G begets <em class="calibre3">another</em> new note, which is the tripling of the tripling: namely, D (9:1), as shown in example 6.2a.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">With octave reduction, the perfect twelfths become perfect fifths, as seen in example 6.2b. (This harmonic generation is preserved in conventional classical nomenclature by the term “the dominant of the dominant,” meaning the fifth scale degree above the fifth scale degree.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If we leave out the middle term (the G) and further octave-reduce the C, the result is the whole tone shown in example 6.2c. Could this be what Lao-tzu’s commentator meant when he refers to the “spirit of Harmony as it <em class="calibre3">condenses</em>”?</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The process of generating new, more complex tones (with high-number ratios) from simpler tones (with low-prime ratios) is 
called <em class="calibre3">stacking,</em> or <em class="calibre3">compounding</em>. The concept of compounding fifths is easy: They stack like Tinkertoys or Lego blocks; so do thirds, as we shall see, and fifths and thirds combine with themselves and each other, building out in any direction, as we shall also see. But the vibrational experience of singing compounded harmonies in tune is the crucial thing. Such experience is none other than the operative principle of tonal harmony, the very gift that allows us to make music. How the ear decodes and interprets complex harmonies compounded from simple ones is almost a complete mystery to us, although there has been some fascinating speculation (discussed in the afterword). My way of softening the mystery is to remind myself that the ear and sound are not unrelated things, in the same way that a glove and a hand are not unrelated. The ear was made to hear sound. That it responds to the elemental wave forms locked inside complex harmonies does not seem unnatural. Even though we can’t describe it yet, we sense that the anatomy of hearing is similar to the anatomy of harmony. When you study one you study both. The study of music is the study of one’s own ear. That’s why it is not enough to simply listen to a harmony (such as a major second) and say, “I hear it.” You have to go so deeply into your experience that you hear yourself hearing it.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although we will not continue on with the tripling process at the moment, as many new notes as we can use are thus generated by the powers of three. Indeed, Pythagoras, who lived in Greece around the same time that Lao-Tzu lived in China, thought that tripling was the only acceptable harmonic principle; consequently, the harmonic system generated by compounding fifths and reducing octaves is called Pythagorean.</p>

        <p class="ctx">You could use a piano to generate two fifths, because the piano’s equal-tempered fifths are not too badly mistuned. But a more certain path is to tune two guitar strings as well as you can by ear, as shown in example 6.3a. To check your tuning, match the third partial of C (the appropriate node is over the seventh fret) with the second partial of G (the node is over the twelfth fret).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">When your tuning is pure, proceed by sounding the fourth partial of the C (the appropriate node is over the fifth fret) together with the third partial of G (seventh fret), as shown in example 6.3b. If you get the tuning right, with the overtones robust and well sustained, the hollow spaciousness of the “dissonance”—for such is how we conventionally term the “interval” of the major second—is illuminating.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Remember that listening to overtones and pure harmonies can serve as a guide only; let the proof of what you are seeking be in your singing. That proof is not here on the page. It is (bless the fact) in your own body.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">While you are singing, remember to appreciate that, in harmonic terms, C and D are not neighbors but live two houses away. One might ask the riddle, “Harmonically speaking, what lies between C and D?” (If you say “C<span class="fon">#</span>” or “D<span class="fon">b</span>” the author will have to immolate himself immediately.) Awareness of the reality in which G lives between C and D—whether or not it is being heard as a note in the air—is the goal. It is a light that goes on inside.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">With appropriate octave reduction, we now have an attractive four-tone scale, shown in example 6.5. Against a C and G drone, very slowly improvise melodies in this scale, singing in tune, feeling
the qualities, and knowing
that you know the
harmonic derivations as you go. The enormously subtle change of flavor between <em class="calibre3">re</em> and <em class="calibre3">ga</em> is especially recommended. A hungry musician type could spend very long moments savoring that one.</p>

        <p class="ctx">At this point, we could profit from a new notation. Since there are two harmonically functional elements (perfect fifths and major thirds) and two dimensions on a sheet of paper (horizontal and vertical), we can array the fifths along a horizontal axis and the thirds along a vertical axis. A picture of harmonic space will begin to emerge, as seen in figure 6.1.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The notion that perfect fifths can be drawn along a strictly horizontal east–west axis and major thirds along a strictly vertical north–south axis has been usefully employed in the study of acoustics since the late nineteenth century. We’ll call such a depiction <em class="calibre3">compass orientation</em> and employ it frequently later on in the book.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Notice that the horizontal axis is tilted somewhat counterclockwise, now lying more in the southwest-to-northeast direction, while the vertical axis is tilted slightly clockwise, leaning to the northeast. Although our “directions” are now less easily named, there is a great advantage in using the musical staff as a reference.

        <p class="ctx">It is amazing to realize how the major seventh has, hidden inside it, the consonances of both the major third and the perfect fifth. Discovering this is a little like looking through a microscope and finding the abundance of cells in one drop of blood difficult to believe even though you are seeing them with your own eyes. If you go over the procedure for playing and singing given above, however, the incredible seems at least more familiar and comfortable. Most of the music you have ever heard or will hear is essentially perfect fifths and major thirds, similarly compounded, and the wonder of that never goes away.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Since the major seventh is compounded from a fifth and a third, would it be reasonable to expect that its quality reflects, somehow, the sum of the qualities of its constituent elements? Maybe so, maybe not. Many have said much on this subject, but it is your work to realize your own sensibilities. You have to keep checking the B with the G and the G with the C and the B with the C and not giving up.</p>

Notice that both the major seventh and the augmented fourth can move upward by a semitone to a note of relative simplicity, giving a feeling of great harmonic release as a result of a small melodic step. Taken all together, our collection of harmonies can make a rich and buoyant scale, up and down, as seen in example 6.14.

        <p class="calibre5">The full harmonic map so far is shown in example 6.15.

This begins to show the organizing principle of a tone lattice: spines of fifths stacked a third apart.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It is a useful and challenging practice, at least at this point, to try to keep in mind the harmonic derivation of the tones, even while you are singing. I like to use <em class="calibre3">pa</em> and <em class="calibre3">ga</em> as generic mental abbreviations for “perfect fifths (3:2)” and “major thirds (5:4).” The harmonic derivation of D, then, is “the <em class="calibre3">pa</em> of <em class="calibre3">pa</em>” (or grand-<em class="calibre3">pa</em>: ha ha). The major seventh then becomes “the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> above <em class="calibre3">pa</em>,” and the augmented fourth becomes “the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> above the <em class="calibre3">pa</em> of <em class="calibre3">pa</em>” (the third above the fifth above the fifth).

        <p class="csht">Where Does This Stuff Come From?</p>
        <p class="ctx">Here is a remarkable truth that is emerging from the work we are doing: We know that the overtones of a single fundamental are not entirely obvious to the ear, and that the overtones of the overtones are less obvious still. They are soft at best and disappear rapidly into inaudibility. So when we sing tones compounded from the first five partials, we are making audible and sensible a real but inaudible world locked inside the fundamental tone. For instance,<span> </span>you will not encounter the overtone corresponding to the F<span class="fon">#</span> we have just been singing until you climb to the <em class="calibre3">forty-fifth</em> partial (its ratio is 45:32), and that is an overtone entirely inaudible from any string. But you can learn the resonance of that F<span class="fon">#</span><span> </span>with such certainty that you can put it in your pocket. We don’t hear harmony simply by matching overtones—it happens another way, a more ecological way. The overtones and our voices are relating not so much to each other as to a higher principle. Something prior organizes both. The overtones are our siblings, not our parents. The forces that govern the production of overtones govern our ears also, and our ears’ responses, and our hunger for musical harmony, and our pleasure in it. It is true that we can represent these parental forces as a schema of low prime numbers, but the forces themselves confound our minds. That is why we so love to experience them as music: It is a way of honoring our minds’ source. The hidden universe inside a string we thus make explicit and resounding by our singing. And what are we singing? We are singing what is already there. Our tones render the subliminal sensible. They represent a once angelic, refined world now made coarse, a heaven brought down to earth—spirit incarnate, <em class="calibre3">condensed.</em></p>

We have discovered so far exactly half of this central area of twelve notes (the upper half). It would be wise to tarry here before going on to the other half. Be patient and practice your singing against the drone. Let your melodies be driven and drawn by harmonic states. Gain enough certainty in this overtonal world to claim familiarity with the neighborhood. Gain the trust of the notes, and their friendship. Give them something.

      <p class="ctx">OUR OPERATIONAL PREMISE IS THIS: Harmony consists of perfect fifths, major thirds, their compounds, <em class="calibre3">and their reciprocals.</em> That is different from saying that all the notes in music are overtones—such a claim could not be made. The truth is that the overtone series <em class="calibre3">encodes</em> the secret of all tonal harmony. By examining directly the first few overtones and their compounds we have done the easier part. The deep part is next.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-56" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Reciprocal Tones</p>
        <p class="ctx">Let me begin with a statement that may seem odd: The note we recognize as the fourth degree of a major scale does not appear in the overtone series. If the generating tone is C, then the F above it, the “perfect fourth,” never appears, not even if you ascend to the millionth overtone. It’s not there. Yet that note has been discovered in virtually every culture; all human ears want it and find it. Humans who sing, sing it. It sounds and feels close to home, safe, and totally right. So if it isn’t an overtone, what is it?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To answer this question, let’s pose another, not-so-innocent question: What exactly is the overtone series of this famous F we’ve been talking about? When you see it and hear it, the answer to the riddle of the perfect fourth is not far off. Look for a moment at example 7.1. The third partial of F is that very tone—C—which in its role as the fundamental, or generating tone, has given meaning to all the other tones we have studied so far.</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">To bring this more into your own experience, play C in a higher octave and sing F in low range (for women) and midrange (for men) as in example 7.2. The exercise is to tune the F in your voice until it sounds as if C is your third partial, or perfect twelfth.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This may be musically obvious or it may not be. In any case, let’s adopt a rigorously patient attitude here. Of all the mysterious events in music, we have come to perhaps the most mysterious of all—mysterious because of how the tables have turned: Instead of resonating with a note that has already been placed into the musical space by a generating tone, we have invented—<em class="calibre3">created</em>—a note that contains the generating tone in its harmony. It is one thing to produce a vibration that is already given, that is “already there.” It is quite another to become that vibration which produces, as one of its children, the very tone you started with.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Within the boundaries of music, the generating tone does behave somewhat like a creation principle. It is the god of its tonal world. C is the god of the realm of all C modes, of all the music “in C.” But when you sing F you <em class="calibre3">create</em> C. How can you create the creative principle? How does one go about giving birth to a musical god? That is the work of the Musical Mother. Hello, Mother. You who dare to sing F in the C world become the embodiment of the creative and the sacred.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This is only a way of talking, of course, but it is an old and useful way. The nonverbal truth dawns at the very moment you position yourself to become the generator of the generating tone, when you set about to tune the sung F. Practicing this is a kind of uncovering. During the most intense moment of listening to the C, that split second between inhaling and actually singing the F, ask yourself what is happening in the muscles of your throat, in your inner hearing, in the seeking part of your nature, in your feeling. Scrutinize the entire range of feeling at the moment of first vibration, as an exercise in the fleeting present. Whatever that feeling is, it is a crucial kernel of musicality. When you can catch a glimpse of it, the meaning of the term <em class="calibre3">reciprocal</em> clarifies.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-494"></a><a href="#calibre_link-399">*5</a></sup></p>

        <p class="csht">Dominant and Subdominant Compared</p>
        <p class="ctx">Now is the time to compare the forming of the fifth above the tonic with the forming of the fifth below. With this practice, the full breadth and beauty of the harmonic landscape begins to come into view, and we can begin to imagine the other side of the world.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When a string sounds C and you sing a G above, you the singer are inside the string: You are climbing or leaping up inside it, magnifying it and using it. It is like riding a horse: The horse and the saddle are there—you just jump up and take a ride. You are an overtone cowboy.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When a string sounds C and you sing an F below, you become the generating tone of the C. The string now resides inside the singer. <em class="calibre3">It</em> is in <em class="calibre3">you.</em> You become its creator, the mother of it, the overtone mother. Sing some more G’s and some more F’s. To distinguish between their affects, use the new information about harmonic reciprocity, but don’t forget the microscope of intuition.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The nature of the reciprocity between these two tones is found not only in their feelings and in their sounds; it is also reflected in their numbers and names. In the European nomenclature, the fifth above the tonic is called the dominant; the fifth below is called the subdominant. The name “subdominant” has been persistently misunderstood by generations of theory students: Most musicians, even well educated ones, think that the subdominant is so named because it is the fourth degree of its scale, just one degree below the dominant, which is the fifth degree. It is true (alas) that the supertonic—the second degree of the scale—is so named because it is one degree above the tonic. It is also true that the subtonic—the seventh degree—is one degree below the tonic. But the nomenclature is, as usual, inconsistent. The “sub” of subdominant actually refers not to its scalar position but to its harmonic reciprocity. (Later in this book, we sometimes refer to the note a fifth below a given note as the “<em class="calibre3">pa</em> below” that note, indicating a sort of “reciprocal dominant” relationship.) In example 7.3, imagine the G is a tree on the shore of a pond, the C is the water line, and the tree’s reflection in the pond is the F.</p>

It is the honcho among the overtone cowboys, which are, generically, expressive, radiant like the sun, and of course, masculine. The fifth below is usually recognized as having yin properties. It is the Superior among overtone mothers, which are responsive, receptive and luminous like the moon, and of course, feminine.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">One might also note that in Indian <em class="calibre3">sargam,</em> the fourth degree of the scale is called <em class="calibre3">ma,</em> thus rendering the name of the female principle <em class="calibre3">ma</em> and the male principle <em class="calibre3">pa</em>. Very funny.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It might be timely to point out that in our culture’s music, the chordal progressions based on the triads of the dominant and the tonic—called “authentic cadences” or “perfect cadences”—are forthright, final, and defining. Progressions based on the triads of the subdominant—called “plagal cadences” (derived from a Greek word for “oblique”)—are the substance of blues and gospel music as well as the European “Amen”; they seem to lead upward and out into the open. The dance between these upward-leading and downward-tending energies is the basic two-step of our musical heritage. Much more will be said about this subject later, beginning in chapter 20.</p>

        <p class="csht">Singing Practice with <em class="calibre3">Ma</em></p>
        <p class="ctx">All these names are concepts our minds have invented to describe unnameable musical qualities. It is important to remember that the qualities are not mutually exclusive but are constantly exchanging and overlapping aspects of themselves, tumbling and mating in uncountable dimensions. What is needed is not a precise description but the experience of your own voice, singing fifths above and fifths below, so that whatever these qualities are, they become conscious in you.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What is truly tantalizing is what happens in the psyche when the F is lifted from below, where it functions most clearly harmonically, up through the octaves until it sounds a fourth above the tonic, where it lives in the major scale. It still sounds hollow and sonorous, similar in that regard to the sound of a perfect fifth; the perfectness of a “perfect fourth” is easy to hear. But in some sense it is upside down, since it lies above its own overtone. It feels unstable and is considerably more difficult to find and hold—to tune—than a perfect fifth. Is it like a triangle balanced on a point instead of resting on a base? In the world of sixteenth-century counterpoint it is recognized as a perfect consonance, yes, but treated as if it were dissonant, undoubtedly because of its inherent instability and the consequent difficulty for the singer.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The best way to practice <em class="calibre3">ma</em> is in small collections of scalar neighbors. Example 7.6 shows a few possibilities.</p>

Although we will study the subject of “chromatic pairs” in detail as we proceed (especially in chapter 15), at this stage it is clear that these two notes, though near each other in the scale, are far apart harmonically. They are not versions of one another. We will wait until later to mix their energies in a single phrase of music.</p>

        <p class="ctx">It takes even advanced musicians a while to master <em class="calibre3">ma</em>. I currently have a composition student who is one of the creative and developed jazz musicians in my part of the world, an in-tune trumpet player. Recently during a composition lesson, although genuinely surprised to discover the true nature of the subdominant, he seemed sufficiently clear to go on to the next thing. He shrugged and nodded and said, “OK, OK,” much as someone who, suddenly coming upon the immense panorama of an alluvial valley, might say, “Fine, let’s push on.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now it is the following week, and my friend arrives at his lesson perplexed and untalkative. He lurches onto the piano bench, leans on the keyboard, looks up, and says, “Tell me again about <em class="calibre3">ma</em>.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The best wisdom you don’t get all at once. <em class="calibre3">Ma</em> wisdom works on you from the inside and radiates slowly. My student was upset when he recognized that he hadn’t really seen the valley he had been shown. I assured him that entire populations had passed that way without ever once looking up, or coming back. I love these moments in teaching, when musical realization is suddenly widened and deepened almost, it seems, from within the intentions of the Muse herself.</p>
        <p class="ctxtop">My teacher Pandit Pran Nath used to say that singing <em class="calibre3">ma</em> is like stopping time. He told me to color the vowel by putting a slight pressure on my glottis, moving the open <em class="calibre3">ah</em> toward the darker <em class="calibre3">uh</em>. That way, he said, you can hear the color of the sky at midnight.</p>

      <p class="ctxtop">HERE IS A REPHRASING OF OUR OPERATIVE PRINCIPLE: There are two harmonic elements, fifths and thirds, subject to two procedures, above and below. We have found the fifth above, the fifth below, and the third above; now only the third below—the last quark—remains.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-61" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Singing Reciprocal Thirds</p>
        <p class="ctx">I think it is fair to point out the progressive difficulty in these adventures. Fifths above are more obvious than thirds above. Thirds above are more obvious than fifths below. Thirds below are not as obvious as any of these. In order to develop your ability to hear reciprocal thirds, here is a game. Sing “Three Blind Mice,” just the first three notes. (Be careful, now: If this were as simple as it seems I wouldn’t get to have any fun.) You know the tune, do you? Now, with the aid of a piano or a guitar, pick out a single, random pitch in your singing range. Matching that fresh pitch, sing, “Three.” Now, without playing any more notes on the instrument, sing the two remaining notes of the phrase so that you will have sung “Three Blind Mice” by ear, using the new note as the highest pitch. Now leave out the middle note, and sing, “Three Mice,” as shown in example 8.1.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now choose another pitch at random and do the same thing, until you can respond to any pitch by singing the major third below it. Maybe you can already do this without effort. Most musicians, however, do a double take here. The two usual errors are shown in example 8.2. Check it out, making sure your choices for new starting pitches are randomly chosen. You know you have it when your response is virtually instantaneous. (The practice of singing a given interval from a randomly chosen pitch is good for every interval.)</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Now let’s rephrase the problem in harmonic terms. We are in C. We ask the question, “What is C the fifth partial <em class="calibre3">of</em>?” (Answering this question, and others like it that will arise, requires familiarity with the overtone series throughout the chromatic scale—see chapter 1). The answer is A<span class="fon">b</span>. Play the C above middle C on the piano or guitar, but don’t play the A<span class="fon">b</span> on the keyboard or the fretboard. Find it in your voice (it is a well-tuned “Mice”) and tune it so that it sounds both correct in pitch and harmonically resonant, as shown in example 8.3. Use whatever octave transposition or reduction that makes you most comfortable. Sing the syllable <em class="calibre3">dha</em> with a clean, open vowel. (As mentioned in chapter 7, even though the full <em class="calibre3">sargam</em> name is <em class="calibre3">komal dha,</em> the <em class="calibre3">komal</em> is omitted in singing practice.)</p>

        <p class="calibre5"> The C drone, now above you, is your fifth partial as well as the pure third of a major scale starting on A<span class="fon">b</span>. Remember that in order to generate A<span class="fon">b</span>, we momentarily pretended that it was the tonic, even though our larger context is C. We are not really <em class="calibre3">in</em> A<span class="fon">b</span>. That is precisely the trick of perception implicit in reciprocal harmony: A<span class="fon">b</span> generates the harmony, but C is still home—that is, A<span class="fon">b</span> becomes the harmonic <em class="calibre3">root,</em> but C remains the <em class="calibre3">tonic.</em> Keep practicing this exercise until you are convinced that C is your fifth partial—that is, until you have found the reciprocal version of pentamerous resonance.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Remember how the singer of <em class="calibre3">ma</em> placed himself or herself in the position of creating the entire known universe (i.e., the generating tone) as his or her third partial? Similarly, as the singer of <em class="calibre3">komal dha</em> you produce the universe as your fifth partial. This is a sophisticated, deeply musical skill that most musicians in the world do quite intuitively (although this tone is not as universal as <em class="calibre3">pa, ma, ga,</em> or <em class="calibre3">re</em>). I am asking you to render this complex human magic as a conscious action in the present, to both <em class="calibre3">hear</em> the fifth-partial relation between your A<span class="fon">b</span> and the C above you and to <em class="calibre3">know</em> that you are hearing it as the fifth partial. Just as E is the
<em class="calibre3">ga</em> above C, A<span class="fon">b</span> can be experienced as the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> below C, the reciprocal mirror image of E.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The next step is to bring the C drone back into the bass, so that the A<span class="fon">b</span> is a minor sixth above it rather than a major third below it, as shown in example 8.4. It might help, in finding the sweet spot of this harmony, to imagine the higher C above your voice even if it is not sounding explicitly. Maybe that imagining is actually part of the process of singing the note in tune. In any case, the harmonic resonance of the minor sixth is intensely moving. When it is in tune it flies—it seems actually to leap like fire and be upward tending, as if it were looking toward the high drone for a mate. Meanwhile, that very drone is your overtone.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">On the harmonic map, the reciprocal third appears on a new spine positioned below the central spine as shown in example 8.5. Notice the square, solid note head I use for the new spine now emerging. Notice also the new bass clef. The full harmonic map up to this point is given in example 8.6. A cautionary reminder: Equal-tempered major thirds are a little sharp. Another way of saying this is that they are too <em class="calibre3">wide</em>; conversely, just major thirds may seem too low—or too <em class="calibre3">narrow</em>—for ears conditioned to equal temperament. Now, when you turn an equal-tempered third upside down, it is still too wide; conversely, a just third may at first seem too high—that is, the interval between it and the tonic above it may seem too narrow for equal-tempered ears. So when you sing a minor sixth, your piano ears may guide you into singing a little flat. Don’t sing flat. Hold out for the resonance. When you find it, it will indeed be slightly sharp to the piano A<span class="fon">b</span>; the same amount sharp, in fact, that you find the just major third is flat to the piano E.</p>

Traveling vertically on the harmonic map is considerably more difficult than traveling horizontally. The ear moves more easily by fifths than by thirds. We are reminded of the alternation between <em class="calibre3">ma</em> and <em class="calibre3">pa</em> (in chapter 7) and how one can flip between overtonal and reciprocal fifths by moving between adjacent scale steps. In contrast, sing example 8.10 and notice what happens to you.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">One reason it may be more difficult to navigate between the E and the A<span class="fon">b</span> is that there are four scale steps involved, not two. (The interval is a diminished fourth.) But the real difficulty is that thirds are more complex than fifths, so flipping their polarity feels more complex. Fifths are used structurally in music; they are less evocative, more of a resolution than a plot. But thirds have drama in them, a kind of grain or current—almost as if you could detect the 5:4 working itself out in the fluids and membranes of the ear. When you flip that energy you are flipping your inner life.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Though the procedure for finding this harmony may seem a bit abstruse, the harmony itself tunes easily and naturally. To me it has a softness and a gentility, combining the qualities of <em class="calibre3">ga</em> (the third above) and <em class="calibre3">ma</em> (the fifth below): Its ratio is 5:3 (see <a href="#calibre_link-101">Ratios of the Twelve Lattice Tones to Tonic</a>). Compassionate moon? Even though I want you to feel everything I feel, I must let the resonances speak for themselves. Listen to <em class="calibre3">dha</em> over many days. Hear internally the perfect fifth your voice makes with the E above it. Let the vowel of <em class="calibre3">dha</em> be open and clear; hear the breath in it, as if the vowel were the continuation of the<em class="calibre3"> h.</em> Example 9.3 gives some melodic shapes; it also demonstrates the Lydian mode, of which much more will be said in the next chapter. (Notice that for convenience we are now using the initial consonant of the <em class="calibre3">sargam</em> syllable to stand for the whole syllable.)</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Example 9.4 gives the full harmonic map up to this point. The map shows that there is another way of arriving at this same ratio of 5:3. You could first go down a fifth to F, and then go up a third to A. Now the ear will hear the tone as the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> of <em class="calibre3">pa</em> below (instead of the other way around). Although the tone has the same frequency and ratio as before, the context has changed. And as the context changes—even the conceptual context—so changes our experience of the note. The harmonic path will now be as shown in example 9.5.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Perhaps the most reliable way of experiencing this quality involves tuning the low E string of a guitar up a semitone to F so that it makes a perfect fifth below the C string (which is actually the old D string tuned down a whole tone).

        <p class="calibre5">Since this minor third—whose ratio is 6:5—seems like such a basic fact of musical life, it is strange to realize that it is not an element but a mixture of two more elemental things. We are so used to hearing this interval as a minor third <em class="calibre3">up</em> from the tonic that it seems roundabout to refer <em class="calibre3">down</em> from the dominant for its identity. This becomes familiar with practice, however. Just as A<span class="fon">b</span> is the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> below <em class="calibre3">sa,</em> E<span class="fon">b</span> is the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> below <em class="calibre3">pa.</em> Dwell on the reciprocal third (example 9.12).</p>

I can scarcely say the dreaded word, but here goes)—so . . . <em class="calibre3">happy.</em> There. We are told from the beginning that minor is sad, the designated mode for angst and funerals. Well, to be honest, the equal-tempered version of the minor triad <em class="calibre3">is</em> rather sad. The equal-tempered major third down from G to E<span class="fon">b</span> is too <em class="calibre3">wide,</em> making the minor third between C and E<span class="fon">b</span> too <em class="calibre3">narrow,</em> or flat. So piano minor is flat and sounds dull—the fire is out of it. But minor thirds in just intonation, and the minor triads they support, are swift and burning. They have the gypsy left in them, and do some leaping kind of dance.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Is a fifth up and a major third down sun/passion?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In scale practice, while singing the E<span class="fon">b</span>, look for the G internally. Be sure to keep looking for that upward major third, even though the manifest sound is the downward minor third. This is characteristic of reciprocal harmonies.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The full harmonic map so far is shown in example 9.13. The map shows that—as we saw in the case of the major sixth—there is another way to generate the minor third: You could go down a major third and up a fifth, as the arrows of example 9.14 indicate. Although this path results in the identical pitch as the way shown in example 9.11, it is less useful to us musically at this point. If you are interested, though, try the experiment suggested by the map.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">And now, for the finale, allow the fifth partial to continue, damp out the C and the G, and hang on to the E<span class="fon">b</span> without flinching. What remains is example 9.20a for men and 9.20b for women.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Cripes! The interval (in the form of example 9.20b) is called an augmented octave. It is so screechingly dissonant that it hardly ever occurs naked anywhere in traditional non-Western music and was virtually banned from Western music until its wanton use in the twentieth century. Yet there it sits, quietly bright, beckoning beneath the surface of every minor third. I think this is the very quality that makes minor minor. Once you become conscious of the floating major third produced by the fifth partial of the tonic, its mixture into the harmony of the minor third an octave or more below becomes familiar, then expected, then ravishingly gorgeous. So addicted have I (among others) become to the beauty of this particular ratio (the E<span class="fon">n</span> to the E<span class="fon">b</span>, octave-reduced, is 25:24) that in my own music I am continually coaxing it out of the closet onto the stage, where it flourishes. Perhaps it takes some time to love it; lucky for us, time is all we have.</p>

If you are not careful, you might begin to perceive the tonic as F, which is not unmusical, but also not the point. Try the combinations suggested in example 9.34 over a C-and-F drone.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">This is called the Phrygian mode and contains all of the reciprocal thirds we have studied so far. The wisdom of these reciprocal thirds reveals itself over the many hours of many days of practice. When the mode begins to feel familiar, replace the F in the drone with G, if you like. The resulting harmonies will be more complex and commensurately more evocative. To ensure the integrity of the tuning, concentrate on the notes F, D<span class="fon">b</span>, and C in your vocal line. The more certain you are of the resonances, the more compelling will be the melodies drawn out of you.</p>

more like the concentric forces of an atom, or—to fairly include gravity into 
the metaphor—like the limbs and roots of a tree. What we can know from our own

the way to dissect it and analyze its subterranean procedures is by singing from our own inside out, tone by tone, resonance by resonance, over the slanting hours until the cows come home.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Let’s retreat from singing and the sounds of things for a while and try to sharpen the visual image of the harmonic map. The best way to learn it is to draw it from memory. First notice the unconventional arrangement of clefs; special care must be taken with their placement. The treble clefs must form a column down the middle of the page tilted toward the lower right-hand corner. The column of bass clefs, closer to the left-hand margin, must tilt slightly downward toward the lower left, as in figure 10.1.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The central tone of the map, the tonic, I designate by an open diamond with radiating lines. Any tone could be chosen as the tonic, but our discussion has been in the key of C so far, so C belongs in the center: Place it just at the foot of the second treble clef from the top and just behind the coif of the third clef from the top, positioned midway between staves, as shown in example 10.1.</p>

        <p class="ctx"> </p>
        <p class="ctx1">The next step is to draw the line of fifths ascending and descending from C, which is called the central spine of fifths and is notated with open, diamond-shaped noteheads. The trick lies in placing the notes along an imaginary line that is as straight as possible, and as close to horizontal as possible. It can’t be entirely straight because of the space between staves; it can’t be horizontal, of course, because the pitches need to be shown at various degrees above and below the generating tone. When you have drawn the central spine of fifths, lightly draw the connecting line, with small breaks to accommodate the noteheads. Example 10.2a shows good form. Example 10.2b shows bad form: The notes are too close and the unbroken line too steep.</p>

        <p class="ctx1"> </p>
        <p class="ctx1">The next move is to add the thirds above. If you place the first one correctly you’ll get all of them right. Note that a major third always needs to go on a separate staff above its generating tone. Place E in the top staff closer to the C than to the G; then connect E and C with a line, as in example 10.3.</p>

        <p class="csht">Review and Clarification of Terminology</p>
        <p class="ctx">To further clarify our work, here are some definitions adapted from David Doty’s <em class="calibre3">The Just Intonation Primer</em> (see the list of sources at the back of the book).</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Just intonation</em> is any system of tuning in which all the intervals can be represented by whole-number frequency ratios, with a strongly implied preference for the simplest ratios.</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">A prime number</em> is a positive whole number that has as factors only itself and one. There is an infinite array of prime numbers, but only the first few (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) have obvious musical significance. The primes that we have considered in this book so far are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 5, by which is meant unisons, doublings (i.e., octaves), triplings (perfect fifths), and quintuplings (major thirds). A tuning system limited to these primes is called <em class="calibre3">five-limit just intonation.</em></p>
        <p class="calibre5">Two intersecting sets of parallel lines form a <em class="calibre3">lattice</em>. Spines of fifths and spines of thirds form a <em class="calibre3">five-limit lattice</em> in just intonation. A page has two dimensions: horizontal and vertical. The prime number three—the triplings that become a spine of perfect fifths by octave reduction—occupy the horizontal dimension. The prime number five—the quintuplings that become a spine of major thirds by octave reduction—occupy the vertical dimension. (In this study, we have so far skewed our axes into <em class="calibre3">staff orientation</em> so that the horizontal now has a <em class="calibre3">pronounced</em> southwest-to-northeast tilt, and the vertical has a <em class="calibre3">slight</em> southwest-to-northeast tilt.) The prime number two does not appear functionally on the lattice because we have reduced away the octaves; in other words, each position on the lattice stands for a note and all its octaves. Later we extend the lattice outward in both dimensions, but so far we have confined our discussion to a specific field of twelve notes. Hence “a five-limit lattice of twelve notes.”</p>

        <p class="csht">Harmonic Paths</p>
        <p class="ctx">Once you are able to draw the lattice from memory, the boon of its maplike qualities becomes more apparent. This means that when you understand the harmonic relationship of any tone with C, that same harmonic relationship from any other tone becomes graphically clear. For example, the path of B, the major seventh from C, proceeds up a fifth and up a third, as shown in example 10.8. The path without the staff looks like figure 10.2.</p>
        <p class="img">

        <p class="cap"> <b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 10.8</em></b></p>
        <p class="calibre5">If you start on any other tone and follow the same path, you will derive the same harmony with the same quality but from that new tone. Thus, for instance, from F to E, which makes the same harmony, appears as in example 10.9. The same path can be drawn from D<span class="fon">b</span> to C, as well as for three other major sevenths on the map. (What are they?)</p>

        <p class="calibre5">By way of contrast, B<span class="fon">b</span> to A appears on the lattice as shown in example 10.10. Figure 10.3 shows the generic harmonic path for this more complex type of major seventh.</p>

This is obviously a less direct and more distant harmony than the other type of major seventh.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">At this point these activities are merely exercises meant to provide insight. But with more practice and more music making, the five-limit lattice will become quite personalized, a picture of your own harmonic experience.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although three-limit and five-limit tuning systems have been both employed and quantified for well over two thousand years, the first formulation of a five-limit lattice in just intonation was made, I believe, by Alexander Ellis, in the appendix to his 1885 English translation of <em class="calibre3">On the Sensations of Tone</em> by Hermann Helmholtz. His purpose was quite different from ours, however. Ellis, among many of his generation, was chafing against the musical compromises imposed by twelve-tone equal temperament; he wanted desperately to believe that music of the common practice period (roughly the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries), although conceived in equal temperament, could be realized more beautifully and powerfully with an elaborately extended five-limit lattice. The impossibility of that has already been elegantly demonstrated by Easley Blackwood in <em class="calibre3">The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings</em> (see the list of sources). I wish to acknowledge, however, that Ellis intuited over a hundred years ago the practical value of the lattice design, which has now become standard in contemporary thinking about just intonation. The addition of musical staff notation increases even further the practicality of the lattice, allowing its meaning to evolve in real time for each musician as his or her music evolves.</p>

      <p class="ctx">Within the five-limit lattice of twelve notes there is available a great variety of seven-tone modes. We will assume for now that a seven-tone mode contains seven discrete scale degrees designated by the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">We’ll first consider a group of modes ordinarily taught with natural letter names as “the church modes”—the white notes on the piano beginning on C, then D, then E, and so on. We show these “in C,” however, with each mode beginning and ending on C, thus making use of the black keys as well. By this method, all twelve notes from the lattice will make their appearance. Study example 11.1.</p>

      <p class="cap"> <b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 11.1</em></b></p>
      <p class="calibre5">The names of these modes are derived from place-names in ancient Greece. The connection of the actual musical sounds to the actual places, however, has been fuzzed, reversed, or (most likely) obliterated over time and temperament. Yet the names persist in common usage, their false histories rolling sweetly off the tongue. Furthermore, each of these modes has a large number of alternative tunings worldwide. What we are studying here are the least complex modes that are available from the five-limit lattice of twelve notes.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Notice first, as you go down the page from Lydian to Phrygian, that the C and the G do not change; they are fixed. The other five scale degrees have alternate forms. Example 11.2 combines all twelve of the notes into a reference scale that demonstrates this.</p>
      <p class="img">
        <img src="000121.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/>

      <p class="cap"> <b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 11.2</em></b></p>
      <p class="calibre5">Let’s track the degrees as follows:</p>
      <p class="blockh">The fourth degree, F, is augmented (sharped in this case) in Lydian, but perfect (natural in this case) in all the others.</p>
      <p class="blockh">The seventh degree, B, is major in two modes and minor in four.</p>
      <p class="blockh">The third degree, E, is major in three modes and minor in three.</p>
      <p class="blockh">The sixth degree, A, is major in four modes and minor in two.</p>
      <p class="blockh">The second degree, D, is major in five modes and minor in one only, Phrygian.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Notice also that in example 11.1 the modes are arranged on the page so that all five of the degrees that have alternate forms are in their high form at the top of the list and in their low form at the bottom of the list.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">By virtue of their intervalic makeup, these six scales form a group. Not only are the intervals confined to half steps and whole steps only, but the <em class="calibre3">clustering</em> of whole steps is the same for each mode. There is a cluster of two whole steps and a cluster of three whole steps; the clusters are separated by half steps. The situation is most clear and familiar in the Ionian mode, as seen in example 11.3. The brackets beneath the notes show the clustering of whole tones.</p>

      <p class="calibre5">Although these six modes are in the same intervalic family, the family contains an enormous range of moods. <em class="calibre3">Mood</em> and <em class="calibre3">mode</em> are both from the Latin <em class="calibre3">modus,</em> which refers to the measure of something, its limit. <em class="calibre3">Mode</em> refers to a limit that regulates the way in which a thing is done. <em class="calibre3">Mood</em> has come to mean the temper or condition of the mind or the heart. Our progression of modes is also a progression of moods. To understand this better, let’s take a look at the harmonic map of each mode in turn, tracking the gradual transformation from Lydian to Phrygian.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Over the spine of three fifths we see a spine of four overtonal thirds. The only hint of reciprocal energy is in the A, which is a mixture of overtonal and reciprocal energy (up a third and down a fifth). Otherwise the mode is purely overtonal. If overtones are sunny, then, within the confines of our lattice, this is as sunny as any seven-tone mode gets.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">For singing in these modes, use the seven syllables of Indian <em class="calibre3">sargam: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha,</em> and <em class="calibre3">ni,</em> regardless of accidentals. When you sing in Lydian, you may notice that the four overtonal thirds of the upper spine (A, E, B, and F<span class="fon">#</span>) have a somewhat similar quality. They are all <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded, of course, whereas the notes of the central spine are all Pythagorean.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Digression on Terminology</p>
        <p class="ctx">As we have already discussed, a system of tuning containing only octaves and perfect fifths (or doublings and triplings: a three-limit system) is called Pythagorean, based on the philosophical principle that in order to reflect the ideal of perfection music must be limited to the purest—that is, the lowest—generating prime. When we speak of Pythagorean intervals, or ratios, or harmonies, we mean music generated by a single spine of perfect fifths. Systems generated in part or entirely by 5:4-type major thirds do not have such a convenient term; “pentamerous” and “tertiary” are both OK, and I use them both from time to time. But I would like the reader’s permission to borrow from <em class="calibre3">sargam</em> and use the term <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded for tones that mix the energies of perfect fifths and major thirds. The only purebred <em class="calibre3">ga</em>’s in our lattice (computing from C) are E and its reciprocal, A<span class="fon">b</span>—the third above and the third below. All the other notes on the other spines are mixed with perfect fifths, hence <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded. Pure thirds and the tones that contain their energies sound juicy, <em class="calibre3">ga</em> is a great syllable to sing juicy tones with, and blood is the primal juice. Is this going too far?</p>
        <p class="ctx1"> </p>
        <p class="ctx1">Back to singing over a drone. <em class="calibre3">Ga</em>-blooded notes sing beautifully together, especially when they are harmonic neighbors, such as A and B, or E and F<span class="fon">#</span>. Example 11.8 demonstrates this.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice how the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded notes contrast with the Pythagorean G and D. Notice also how the half step between the dissonant F<span class="fon">#</span> and the consonant G and likewise the half step between the dissonant B and the consonant C constitute a built-in system of tension and release. In North Indian music this mode is called <em class="calibre3">Yaman,</em> and musicians often achieve a wondrous, floating effect by avoiding the resolution notes of G and C for long passages. Within such a passage you can hang on to the major seventh for what seems like a week. You may also notice how, since the mode is made mostly of overtones, it takes on a tingling kind of relaxation, a brilliant ease.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-81" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Ionian Mode</p>
        <p class="ctx">Example 11.9 shows the scale and the map of the Ionian mode, which is identical with the Major scale. The most overtonal note, F<span class="fon">#</span>, is gone. In its place is F, the reciprocal fifth, the subdominant. In terms of the lattice of twelve notes, the generating spine is now complete: The four Pythagorean tones are F–C–G–D. Notice that the tones generating thirds (F–C–G) are <em class="calibre3">centered</em> on C, the tonic, thus giving this mode a particularly stable, grounded quality. Because of its harmonic stability, Ionian has become the favored mode of the West; we will say more about this in part 2.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Then gradually fold <em class="calibre3">ga</em> and <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blood into the mix.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The half steps are between B and C (as in Lydian) and also between E and F, which is fascinating because these are so complimentary: E is the third above and F is the fifth below, representing both qualities and both directions. Of the two, F is more consonant but less stable; E is thicker, but more of a release—it simply sits there like the overtone it is. A singer can thereby travel a small melodic distance while covering a wide harmonic sweep. Such felicitously paired neighbors often inspire expressive usage, including trills and ornaments of every description.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It is curious to note that in India, where this mode is the standard reference for singing and teaching, it is not much used in actual music. When Indian kids are first learning their <em class="calibre3">sa-re-ga</em> they sound not unlike American kids learning their <em class="calibre3">do-re-mi.</em> But the mode rarely shows up in <em class="calibre3">raga.</em> Too stable, I think, for everyday dronal fare.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Yet in our culture we are surrounded by the Ionian mode and the harmonies it generates from cradle to grave, and it is easy to take it for granted: plain old Major. But you can never be too alert—the very thing you need most has a way of turning up under your nose.</p>

Mixolydian, which can be a relaxed and easy mode, is a favorite of improvisors from jazz musicians to Indian musicians to “folk” musicians around the world. Notice how there is no half step adjacent to either the tonic or the dominant, thus perhaps damping the urgencies of tension and release. But both half steps can be melodically evocative; especially notice the unique blend of qualities between A and B<span class="fon">b</span>, both <em class="calibre3">ga-</em>blooded.

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The Dorian mode, curiously balanced among its harmonic qualities, has been historically pivotal in the development of Western music and is one of the most-used modes in the world. The central spine is complete. There is one overtonal third and two reciprocal thirds. The entire mode is shaded slightly toward the reciprocal or reflective side of the map, just as Mixolydian (with the difference of one note) is shaded slightly toward the overtonal or active side. The new note, E<span class="fon">b</span>, leads by a half step to and from the adjacent Pythagorean D. The E<span class="fon">b</span> also makes an augmented fourth with A, which may feel unfamiliar in this position.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Traditionally in the West, modes whose third degrees are major are called “Major” and modes whose third degrees are minor are called “Minor.” The first three modes on our list can therefore be thought of as Major; Dorian is the first of the three Minor modes we will consider. It is true, at least to our ears, that the change in energy from overtonal E to reciprocal, <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded E<span class="fon">b</span> is some kind of threshold: Something crucial in us turns around or flips over.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">During medieval times in Europe, before the era of keyboards, triadic harmony, or the musical forms derived from fifth-driven cadences, the Major mode—with its major triad on the dominant—was not the cultural standard of reference. The Dorian mode, with its delicate balance between overtonal and reciprocal energy, occupied the center of the harmonic aesthetic. D Dorian, to be precise. The note D had become, roughly, the central reference pitch. This is still true: D, not C. The strings of our modern orchestra are still tuned as shown in example 11.13.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Thanks to our Western harmonic hungers, we are biased toward the overtonal side of harmonic space, at least in our conceptual thought. But the Major mode itself is not central to harmonic space; Dorian is. And D Dorian is central, both to early music and to modern nomenclature. The Dorian mode in D is all “naturals,” all white notes on the modern keyboard, which happens also to be topographically symmetrical around that note (check out the arrangement of white and black keys with D in the center.) It is easy to see how D is the center of our nomenclature: Go up four fifths and you meet the first sharp (F<span class="fon">#</span>); go down four fifths and you meet the first flat (B<span class="fon">b</span>). Same with a third up and a third down.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In the 1960s, when jazz had become extremely sophisticated harmonically, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and others began to simplify its chains of modulating keys and improvise for long stretches in a single, embellished mode. Interestingly, their improvisational mode of choice was Dorian. Dorian is also a worldwide mode of prayer.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I am saying so much about Dorian, which sits in the middle of our list, because I want you to be able to hear it in a new way, with ears that are not entirely defined by history and culture. I think the secret power of music is in its bare sounds—that is why, with a couple of tunable strings at your disposal, and a voice, and some time to spend, you can discover so much of the true nature of music for yourself. My hunch is that the central position of the Dorian mode in music making is reflected by its central position in our psyche. But that hunch belongs to me. If you get a different impression, it is just as valid. And each person’s valid impression may in fact be different. One truth common to everyone, though, is that the validity of a listening experience is a function of the quality of the listening.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The Aeolian mode is our usual reference for Minor. It contains a central spine of fifths and three reciprocal thirds. There are no overtonal <em class="calibre3">ga</em>’s, and the mode seems to have a kind of stability in the Minor realm that Ionian does in the Major realm. It is very familiar to our ears, and indeed, seems almost universal around the world. Notice the strong leading of the half step from A<span class="fon">b</span> to G, a force so ingrained in our ears that it is difficult for some of us to learn the Dorian mode, which differs from the Aeolian only in that its sixth is major.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Another characteristic sound is the mixing of the energies of A<span class="fon">b</span> and B<span class="fon">b</span>, expressive reciprocal thirds that are whole-step neighbors melodically sandwiched between the dominant and the tonic.

In Phrygian there is no overtonal <em class="calibre3">ga</em> blood, and only one pure overtonal fifth, G. Harmonically the subdominant is prominent, so this is about as reciprocal as music gets, a musical extreme (although, like most extremes, this one can be pushed farther—see chapter 26).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice how the four lower tones of the scale (C, D<span class="fon">b</span>, E<span class="fon">b</span>, F) have the same intervalic progression as the four upper tones (G, A<span class="fon">b</span>, B<span class="fon">b</span>, C): half, whole, whole. Both the tonic and the dominant are approached by half steps from above.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although it takes people in our culture a while to feel comfortable with the Phrygian mode, it is well used and much adored in others, especially in Islamic and Hindu music.

By glancing through their harmonic maps it is clear that the central tones of the central spine—C and G—are always present. Only in the extremely overtonal Lydian is the reciprocal end of the spine, F, missing. Only in the extremely reciprocal Phrygian is the over-tonal end of the spine, D, missing. Notice that as you progress down the list of modes, the tones in the overtonal spine of thirds disappear in order one by one, and the spine of reciprocal thirds gradually grows, until it has replaced the overtonal one. Notice especially how, in the middle four modes—framed on top by Ionian (Major) and on the bottom by Aeolian (Minor)—the central spine does not change. <em class="calibre3">What changes is the directionality of the thirds.</em> This is a crucial redefinition of Major and Minor, which we will take up again in chapter 13 and beyond.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-497"></a><a href="#calibre_link-407">*8</a></sup></p>
        <p class="calibre5">For now, the main thought is that the directionality of the thirds determines the mood. As you work your way down example 11.1 from Lydian to Phrygian, mode by mode, mood by mood, and then back up again from Phrygian to Lydian, you can sense yourself going through a spectrum of sensations, much as if you were riding back and forth through a rainbow. One might consider it a dream journey through the psyche that the singer/dreamer both responds to and controls. You choose and shape the mode, and the mood takes you. You strike a deal with the muse: Sing in tune and she will show you your own heart.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This is the time to get comfortable, set up your tonic-and-dominant drone as musically as possible, and improvise your way gradually from one modal extreme to the other and back again. Take all the time in the world. It is OK to spend an hour on one pass. Or, as you become more certain in your singing, you can make the full compass in a few eventful minutes. I like it both ways.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What about beginning with Phrygian, working your way up to Lydian, and then back down? Fine, but at your own risk—best to watch your feet as you walk away. Anything is fine. It doesn’t matter how you learn these sounds and the relationships among them as long as you are singing, singing in tune, in tune and awake with the intention of knowing.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This is a perfect moment <em class="calibre3">not</em> to say, “Don’t go on until you learn this.” Any one mode is more than a life’s work, so this is the work of more than six lives. Work until you gain some musical experience you can bring forward into the next pile of work. I hope you will be revisiting this place many times, and that singing in these modes will gradually become part of the narrative of your life.</p>

      <p class="ctx2">THERE ARE THIRTY-TWO SEVEN-TONE MODES available from the lattice we have constructed. Of these, we have already considered six; before looking at the rest of them we need to adopt a flexible naming system.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Naming the Tetrachords</p>
        <p class="ctx">The word <em class="calibre3">tetrachord,</em> from Greek, means literally “four strings,” but in its broadest usage it refers to any four consecutive scale degrees. Thus the <em class="calibre3">lower tetrachord</em> of a scale refers to degrees one through four of the scale; the <em class="calibre3">upper tetrachord</em> refers to degrees five through eight. It is easier to divide a mode in half and name each half than it is to name every possible mode. We conventionally name our very own selves the same way for the same reason: We have both a given name and a surname.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When singing scales, and also when talking about them, we ordinarily begin at the bottom and proceed upward, of course. But when <em class="calibre3">naming</em> scales we say the upper tetrachord first and speak of it as being <em class="calibre3">over</em> the lower tetrachord. MA/MI is spoken “Major over Minor” and means “the top four notes of a Major scale over the bottom four notes of a Minor scale.” If we were to demonstrate this scale, we would begin by ascending from the lower tonic, as shown in example 12.1. It’s too bad about the confusion between directions but, fellow traveler, we sing up and we read down. The same problem was encountered in naming ratios.</p>

The tetrachord system of naming will clarify and become more complete as we go through the process of examining the modes one by one.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Modes with Four Consecutive Whole Steps</p>
        <p class="ctx">Like the Lydian-through-Phrygian group of modes, the next group of modes contains only whole steps and half steps. In this group, however, four of the whole steps cluster together and one stands alone. Remember, we are looking at intervals—distances between pitches—not the pitches themselves. Consider the intervals of the mode in example 12.2.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">This mode appears in the conventional nomenclature as “the ascending Melodic Minor,” so named even though the scale is liberally taken in both directions. In North Indian music as well as in contemporary Western uses it is not necessarily direction oriented. Jazz musicians in the 1990s call it “Jazz Minor.” There are four modes with a similar whole-tone clustering within our lattice, listed in example 12.3.</p>

        <p class="csht1">MIXOLYDIAN OVER LYDIAN (MIX/LYD)</p>
        <p class="ctx1">The MIX/LYD scale and its harmonic map are shown in example 12.4. The map reveals a
new phenomenon: The upper spine has a gap in it. One of the vertebrae has migrated to the lower spine. This new way of mixing overtonal and reciprocal thirds is characteristic of this group of modes. Notice that the tone D has (in the lattice) a major third both above and below it. Notice also (in the scale) the diminished fourth from F<span class="fon">#</span> up to B<span class="fon">b</span>.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">This mode does not appear frequently in the world’s music, the notable exception being in jazz, where, thanks to its amenable harmonic nature, it is extremely useful in modulation. Jazz musicians call it the “Lydian-dominant” mode because it is a cross between Lydian and the “dominant seventh” mode, which is a nickname for Mixolydian. More practically, it is called “sharp-four flat-seven” (or “aug-four minor-seven” more recently and more correctly). Phrases such as example 12.5 are typical in bebop.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="ctx">Indeed, jazz players usually cut their teeth by learning to improvise fluently in this mode in all twelve keys—a high-literacy stunt few jazz musicians have ever regretted.</p>
        <p class="csht1">MAJOR OVER MINOR (MA/MIN)</p>
        <p class="ctx">Example 12.6 shows the MA/MIN scale and its harmonic map. In this mode the central spine is complete, but the third degree, now minor, has migrated to the lower spine. Even though we hear the mode as basically Minor (as we have mentioned), there is nonetheless a balanced mix of overtonal and reciprocal energy that gives its music a kind of rounded feeling. Notice that it is now the note G that has major thirds sprouting up as well as hanging down from it. The diminished fourth is from B up to E<span class="fon">b</span>, giving fascinating melodic possibilities within this compass, shown in example 12.7.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The cluster of four whole tones spans from E<span class="fon">b</span> up to B, allowing the melodic sequence of major thirds shown in example 12.8. I don’t like 
to play favorites, but I will report that this mode has been a deep source of 
music in my life. It generates gorgeous compositions in North Indian music, but 
is, apart from region or history or style, intrinsically generous. European classical music uses it only fleetingly, so when you stay inside it for a long while the music seems familiar yet new. Every now and then I get to give a really hot tip, and now is one of those times: Check out this mode. It is a clear window into the pure resonances music is made from.</p>

        <p class="csht1">MINOR OVER MAJOR (MIN/MA)</p>
        <p class="ctx">The MIN/MA scale and its harmonic map are shown in example 12.9. The central spine is complete. E, which has resumed its place on the upper spine, is now the lone overtonal third, and the gap appears in the lower spine. The mode sounds essentially Major to us, but with a strong mixture of Minor. Notice that it is C, the tonic itself, that supports a major third both above and below. Also notice how the tonic sits exactly in the middle of the cluster of four whole tones, with two above and two below; this probably tends to smooth out melodic tension. The diminished fourth is now from E up to A<span class="fon">b</span>, and very juicy in that position. When you sing it, be sure, as usual, to keep the major third mellow and the minor sixth bright: Don’t let the E creep high and the A<span class="fon">b</span> creep low, that is, melodically toward each other.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although this mode also occurs fleetingly in classical music, it does not seem to be much used worldwide. Yet I find it a great comfort to the singer, compositionally friendly, and an accessible mixture of the homey and the exotic.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">I call the last of this group of modes Dark Horse because even though it is strange to the point of seeming alien, it contains winning possibilities when you learn to handle it. Dark Horse has only one pure overtone: the dominant, G; the tone that supports a major third both above and below is the subdominant, F. It is identical to Phrygian but for the major sixth, which makes it doubly difficult for us to hear. Although you will most probably find the tonal combinations unfamiliar, it is still part of our five-limit lattice of twelve notes, and well within the experiences of resonance we have undergone so far. I’ve rarely heard Dark Horse performed in this tuning—which doesn’t mean it isn’t alive and thriving somewhere. You can save it for a rainy day, or let it graze on you occasionally if it gets hungry. The nature of a dark horse is to appear unexpectedly.</p>

        <p class="csht">Modes with Five Consecutive Whole Steps</p>
        <p class="ctx">There remains an additional group of modes consisting of only half steps and whole steps. In this group all five whole steps cluster together. If we continue to keep the tonic and the dominant fixed—as we must inside our lattice of twelve notes—there are only two modes that arise within this definition.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The first is <em class="calibre3">Minor over Lydian,</em> written MIN/LYD. The scale and its harmonic map are shown in example 12.11.</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The harmonic symmetry of the map (around G) is amazing. Both upper and lower spines have gaps. Now both C <em class="calibre3">and</em> D have major thirds above and below. But melodically, aside from the two half steps, which cling to G, everywhere you sing is whole steps, and that seems to place an uncanny constraint upon the ear. One way of approaching the problem is to sing within only one tetrachord at a time, folding each tetrachord into the other cautiously, note by note.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The other mode of this group is <em class="calibre3">Major over Phrygian,</em> written MA/PHRYG. The scale and its harmonic map are shown in example 12.12.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">In this case the harmonic symmetry is positioned around C itself. Also, the half steps surround C. Now the whole steps span from the second degree, D<span class="fon">b</span>, all the way up to the seventh degree, B, giving the singer a most bizarre task. Yet once again the problem can be ameliorated by proceeding one tetrachord at a time while seeking serendipitous introductions across borders. I’ve never heard either of these two modes performed in dronal music, although they both have benign harmonic results (especially in equal temperament, discussed in chapter 24). At this point you could consider them instructive oddities. On the other hand, one never knows for certain where one might find a friend.</p>

        <p class="csht">Modes Containing Augmented Seconds</p>
        <p class="ctx">Within our lattice there are no more modes consisting of only half steps and whole steps—we have “exhausted the possibilities,” to use Arnold Schoenberg’s oft-quoted phrase. There are, however, twenty (!) more modes available in the lattice, each containing at least one augmented second. Some of these modes are extremely useful musically, others quite marginally so—or at least, they are seldom used. Although we will not examine each one of them in detail, I would like to present a practical framework within which these modes, as well as all seven-tone modes in general, can be considered. First, however, let’s look at the augmented seconds available in our lattice and familiarize ourselves with the properties of this new interval. The three possibilities are shown in example 12.13. Example 12.14 shows their harmonic maps.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The harmonic path for each augmented second, shown in figure 12.1, is a third up plus a fifth up plus another third up, or a total of one fifth up plus two thirds up. Augmented seconds have a tainted reputation in the Western mind. The usual reason given for their ban in pre-nineteenth-century polyphony is that the extra distance between scale degrees interrupts the melodic flow or in some other way unduly calls attention to itself. But it may also be, since the augmented second was—and is—an extremely evocative interval typical of non-European (specifically Middle Eastern and Asian) music and does not appear in the lexicon of church modes, that the ban may have functioned as an unspoken social and racial boundary, a code for identifying us and them. In the nineteenth century, when association with ethnic roots came to be viewed in a more positive light, augmented seconds began to creep into the music of Chopin, Smetana, and other Eastern European composers. But they still sound foreign to most of us unless we grew up in the Bulgarian countryside, or in Cairo, or Calcutta, or attended a shul in Brooklyn.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Augmented seconds are not to be avoided. They present, in the form of adjacent scale steps, a harmonic path between reciprocal and overtonal thirds, which means they are emotionally juicy and can be musically nourishing.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Here are some modes with augmented seconds in them.</p>
        <p class="csht1">HARMONIC MINOR</p>
        <p class="ctx">Harmonic minor is taught in classical European theory not as a scale to be ordinarily used in its own right, but as the scalar residue of the harmonic cadence most characteristic of the Minor mode (example 12.15).

I once complained to my teacher, Pandit Pran Nath, that I was having trouble singing even the scale in tune, much less the music that comes from it. “It is difficult in India,” he said, which made me feel, actually, much better.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Remaining Possibilities</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is possible to list methodically all thirty-two modes available in our lattice of twelve notes, but instead, let me demonstrate an organization that allows them all to be seen at a glance.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Since C and G are fixed, there are only four possible upper tetrachords, as shown in example 12.21.</p>
        <p class="img">

            <em class="calibre3">Example 12.21</em>
          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">As for the lower tetrachord, let’s pretend for the moment that F also is fixed—F<span class="fon">#</span> does not exist for now. In that case, the lower tetrachord also has only four possibilities, as shown in example 12.22.</p>
        <p class="img">

            <em class="calibre3">Example 12.22</em>
          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now substituting F<span class="fon">#</span> for F, we will run those four possibilities again, as shown in example 12.23.</p>
        <p class="img">
          <img src="000159.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">By means of the arrangement of tetrachords shown in example 12.24, the full range of combinations can be seen.</p>
        <p class="img">
          <img src="000160.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/>

        <p class="cap">
          <b class="calibre8">
            <em class="calibre3">Example 12.24</em>
          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Here is how to use the arrangement: Choose any lower tetrachord, then combine it in turn with each of the four upper tetrachords. For instance, beginning with the MA lower tetrachord, we get MA/MA (which is simply Major, of course); MIX/MA (which is Mixolydian); HAR.MI/MA; and MI/MA. Then go through the same process for the MI lower tetrachord, and so on until you have gone through all eight lower tetrachords.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Why do this? To satisfy curiosity is one good reason. The possibility of uncovering a sleeper mode is another good reason. But for me the reason is that it gives a good general model for the construction of most seven-tone modes and, as we proceed onward to equal temperament, it becomes a powerful model indeed—an excellent way to keep your bearings when modes begin to modulate. (Chapter 40 is devoted to the mechanics of modal modulation in equal temperament.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Meanwhile, having looked at every mode generated by the five-limit lattice of twelve notes, we have, so to speak, covered that field. There is such a wealth of potential music in this material that we need to pause from constructing maps and charts and mental models. It’s time to gather up this information and carry it inside the house to our private room and sit quietly with the sound of it all for a while without being too distracted by the gossip of the intellect.</p>

        <p class="csht">Tell Me Again Why I Should Do All This Singing</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is unlikely that—at least up to now—you have dedicated your life to singing over a drone. We are not a culture of North Indian singers. (Neither is North India anymore—the up-and-coming young bloods want to write film scores.) It is true that our jazz and country and pop singers often sing quite beautifully in tune above and beyond, so to speak, their equal-tempered accompaniments. With my own ears I have, from time to time, heard American opera and art song vocalists sing in tune. Generally speaking, however, we are not a population of singers who want to know, systematically and intellectually, what we are doing. So when I ask you to be calm and sing in tune and know precisely where you are both melodically and harmonically, I am asking you to go against culture.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Does this mean that there could be something lost or forgotten in the culture that we can help to replace? Yes, it does. Singing in tune is the central experience that fully realizes tonality in us, and since the dawn of the age of the fretboard and the keyboard that realization has lost its edge. I think Europe in the fourteenth century was very much in tune, as in tune as the tribal Africa of today or the classical India that still survives, and careful readings and excellent contemporary performances of the works of Machaut and Landini and Ciconia corroborate this. But in America especially that sensibility has, over the centuries, drained away. The music of the folk, by which I mean us bebop heads and country music lovers, tends to react against this trend: Good singers and players of every style strive to be in tune, of course. But the battle against prevailing standards is uphill. If the inherently pure harmony that is lost to us—that lost causality, one might say—is ever to be reclaimed, each one of us has to claim it individually for herself or himself. It would not be the first time that musicians have led culture.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I’m not saying that other cultures historically have learned to sing in tune by singing consciously over a drone. Some have, some haven’t. What I’m saying is that with a couple of tunable strings and some time to burn you can teach yourself what the culture does not know how to teach you. This is the work that must be done to fully comprehend (as opposed to simply use) the tools of modern music making. It is what I am asking you to consider, and it is a consideration not only for yourself. By singing a tone in tune, you tune your room and your family and your neighborhood. It is not otherworldly that this is so. You place the energy of your sound into <em class="calibre3">this</em> world, and this world’s energy does not die; instead, it transforms. And whatever it transforms into carries with it forever the history of your good intentions.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Here are some practical considerations that may help you with the process of singing in tune.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Vibrato</p>
        <p class="ctx">One can sing with or without vibrato. In cultures where in-tune singing is primary, the singing voice is essentially straight, with vibrato used deliberately for ornamental and evocative purposes. The situation in the West is quite different. By the nineteenth century cities had swollen, concert halls had grown proportionately, and the operatic voice that could rise above the orchestra to the farthest seat of the highest balcony had become the aesthetic paradigm. Singing became equated with aural and emotional power, gut driven and gut minded. From the powerful muscles of the diaphragm can arise a vibrato so wide—often a whole tone or more—that the center of pitch easily becomes unfocused. The resulting sound is often glorious, but refinement of pitch is rare.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Some singers raised on the Western operatic model fear that they will lose power—not just volume, but emotional and psychic power—if they lessen their vibrato. Yet all you have to do is listen to the truly powerful singers of Africa and India and Bulgaria to see how provincial that view is. You need not lose your power by singing without vibrato. The same process that gives a singer an open sound also gives sovereignty over vibrato. Once you know you are in tune, once you feel that, then you can use vibrato intentionally as a beautiful, conscious refinement. Vibrato used in such a manner typically looks like figure 13.1.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-499"></a><a href="#calibre_link-411">*10</a></sup></p>

        <p class="csht">Double Think</p>
        <p class="ctx">This is a reminder about the separate yet interpenetrating realms of melody and harmony. The fact that harmonic and melodic sensibilities are both disjunct and conjoined is hard to learn and easy to forget. You do not need to be intellectually aware of this with every note you sing, of course; that would take you too far from the action. But as an occasional, deliberate reminder of the interpenetration of realms, it is good, with a lattice map before you, to sing simply in <em class="calibre3">sargam</em> while your eye travels from note to note within the harmonic grid (as introduced in chapter 10).</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Between the Notes</p>
        <p class="ctx">People who read music, especially keyboard players, are conditioned to suppose that music consists of a series of points in space, and that to make a melody we proceed directly from point to point. This model has something in common with the kid’s comic-page game of Connect the Dots: You connect numbered dots with straight lines to produce an image. The straight lines themselves have no shape; only what they connect has shape. In the sounds produced by keyboards, keyed woodwinds, fretboards, and valved brass, the fixed-pitch model engendered by our notation is carried forward into a culture of Connect-the-Dots music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Most of the rest of the world’s music neither proceeds from nor is communicated by notation—at least not a notation as sophisticated as ours. Rather, it passes aurally from musician to musician, parent to child, mouth to mouth, heart to heart. The tones of such music are not so much dots as they are shapes in and of themselves, impatiently alive and wriggling. They are drawn with a wide palette of curves and angles and textures in thin and bold strokes, and the meaning of the music is given at least as much by these shapes as by the dots they connect.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Furthermore, if we perceive the tones of a melody as their harmonic essences, as states of resonance, then the shapings of the notes become journeys from one feeling state to another. The ride becomes as important as the destination. Since, in just intonation, the destination is a discrete absolute, the singer can continuously contrast the fleeting adventures of the journey with the certainty of the outcome. This lends even “simple” melodies a dramatic, emotionally redolent context that becomes the through line of the music, the plot of the story. As Pandit Pran Nath used to say, “The music is between the notes.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In Western classical singing, the art of connecting notes is called <em class="calibre3">portamento</em>; it is used both evocatively and decoratively. In North Indian music it is called <em class="calibre3">meend</em> and is cultivated not only to deepen the sensibilities of the singer but also to strengthen and refine the voice. Let me suggest a basic <em class="calibre3">portamento,</em> or <em class="calibre3">meend,</em> practice that can raise the singing of lattice melodies to a new plateau of musical possibility.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The basic trick is to use the name of a note while moving it around. For example, sing the pitch <em class="calibre3">ga</em> using the syllable “ga” in the usual straightforward manner; then slide slowly up through the half step to <em class="calibre3">ma</em>; then, a moment after you arrive at the perfect fourth, articulate “ma,” as shown in figure 13.2.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The various dimensions of the <em class="calibre3">meend</em> are yours to shape: the slope of the line, the amount of time spent on the old note before leaving it; the amount of time spent on the new note before naming it, the dynamics, the vowel shapes, and so on.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Some hints:</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li class="calibre10">Be sure the resting places are really in tune.</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Smooth the slope. Imagining a smooth curve helps.</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Try various speeds, but be sure you understand slow-motion <em class="calibre3">meend</em>. The more time you hang out between notes, the more you will learn.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="calibre5">There are four basic kinds of <em class="calibre3">meend,</em> shown in figure 13.5 and example 13.3. All four are beautiful and have appropriate uses. Experiment with one at a time slowly, as if each were a new friend whom you will get to know gradually over the years.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We have examined <em class="calibre3">meend</em> using only steps, but thirds, fourths, and even larger leaps, including octaves, are common. These will most naturally come into your singing once the stepwise versions are familiar.</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Meend</em> vivifies melodies, making them sanguine and glossy and velvety by turns, saturating them with feeling. Even a small dose of this practice can significantly change the way you listen to music, especially sung music, by opening up the deep world that lies underneath the surface. The compelling melodic subtext that was always there—perhaps even in your own music—will seem lit from the inside.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Territory</p>
        <p class="ctx">Our work so far has been confined to twelve specifically tuned tones sounded against a drone, and we have tried to articulate, in various ways, the harmonic experiences that result. We have described the hearts of triple and pentamerous nature and traced how our responses are the architects of a coherent system of modes. To locate the coordinates of our responses, we have made a map for the eye and explored its many roads, using the vocabulary of map reading: north, south, east, and west. To maximize the connection to real music in real time we have employed musical notation and observed the appearance of sharps (one so far) and flats (four). For the sake of certainty, we have quantified our experiences with numbers, pinning down the tones by means of their ratios like so many chloroformed butterflies. To further describe an ordered spectrum of responses we have used such archetypical symbols as sun and moon, or such archetypical characters as mothers and cowboys, and an array of sensual metaphors like bright and easy and velvety. Finally, we have hinted at the notion that harmony is some kind of inner real estate, a landscape through which, perhaps like oxen, perhaps like mermaids, or even like falcons, we draw and navigate and fly our music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As you spend time improvising dronal music, I hope that your curiosity about this last subject will emerge. What is harmonic territory the territory <em class="calibre3">of</em>? Is it the territory of the inner ear? Or the mind, or the brain? Or the heart, or the psyche? Or somehow all of these? The answer is, of course, that even if it proves impossible to describe, it is nevertheless <em class="calibre3">your</em> territory and is eminently possible to explore. A true musician knows the inner ground.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Singing is the royal road to this inner land. Once inside, you become the mapmaker. You name the canyons and ranges, the hidden valleys, the underground rivers, the unnameable. The most amazing thing is that your map seems to be more or less identical to mine. That’s why music connects individuals, communities, cultures, maybe someday a global population: We are more the same than different. And yet, <em class="calibre3">vive la différence</em>. Without it, music, like evolution, would be long gone.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In any case, sing, sing, sing. Let the lattice be your guide until, like a good guide, it becomes invisible against the scenery.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Singing Practice</p>
        <p class="ctx">You can’t learn everything right away, but you can expect to form good habits, which means, basically, practicing regularly and staying awake. However long your practice sessions, I suggest you spend most of the time using <em class="calibre3">sargam</em> and the rest of the time using open vowels—<em class="calibre3">ah</em> mostly—or any syllables that bear repetition or accrue power through repetition. It is good to have favorite modes that you learn well; you don’t have to learn more than a few to cover most of the ground. For instance, Lydian and Phrygian between them take in all twelve notes. Try composing melodies in your favorite modes, learning them with appropriate <em class="calibre3">meend,</em> and then using these as departure points for improvisation.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The results of singing practice come on quickly. You can expect your ear to improve, with better pitch and greater certainty. You gain musical authority. And you learn, too, about your own musical behavior, including both the denial and acceptance of your innate gifts. And last but not least, you set the stage for what is to come: an understanding of the entire range of harmonic experience in twelve-tone equal temperament.</p>

Ratios Xray the skeleton of music, revealing the structure behind its motions. Let’s take some time to clarify what has already been said about ratios and then proceed a little farther. First we will revisit “octave reduction.”</p>
<p class="p">    A ratio (3:2) operates enough like a fraction <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span><span class="symbol">)</span></span> that we may substitute one form for the other when talking about music. We have already seen that the point of octave reduction is to place all relationships within the compass of an octave, that is, between a given tonic, which we call 1, and its octave, 2:1. Since 2:1 as a fraction equals <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">1</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>, or simply 2, we can now redefine the purpose of octave reduction as follows: We want the numbers to be greater than 1 and less than 2. In other words, the value of all our ratios expressed as fractions must lie between 1 and 2. To accomplish this we simply double either the numerator or the denominator a sufficient number of times, as our examples will soon demonstrate.</p><p class="calibre5">A simple process for finding the ratio that corresponds to the harmonic relationship of a scale tone to its tonic is as follows: Let a given tonic (C, for the time being) be known as 1. Track the harmonic path of the scale tone on the lattice. Each time you go up by a fifth, multiply times 3—that is, place 3 in the numerator. Each time you go up a third, multiply times 5—that is, place 5 in the numerator. Each time you go down a fifth, divide by 3—that is, place 3 in the denominator. Each time you go down by a third, divide by 5, placing 5 in the denominator. The resulting fraction indicates the harmonic relationship of the two tones. If the fraction is greater than 1 but less than 2, the second tone lies within the compass of an octave above the tonic. But if the fraction is less than 1 or greater than 2, we need to octave-reduce by halving or doubling the numerator or the denominator a sufficient number of times until the fraction lies between 1 and 2. That new number is the ratio of the two tones within an octave, with the tonic represented by the denominator and the scale tone by the numerator. It is musically helpful to realize that the ratio is not an abstraction floating in the mind. It quantifies actual physical stuff: how many times the upper tone is vibrating (in a given period) in respect to the lower tone. (Remember “<em class="calibre3">x</em> of these per <em class="calibre3">y</em> of those” in chapter 2?)</p><p class="calibre5">For example, here are the twelve tones of the lattice, each expressed as a ratio with C.

        <p class="csht">Why Are There Seven Tones in a Scale?</p>
        <p class="ctx">I have been harping on the musical benefits that accrue to those fluent in ratio-speak. I would like to amplify this by raising what may seem at first to be a tangential question: Why are there seven tones in our scales?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Two ready answers are: (1) even though many theories have been put forth, no one actually knows; and (2) there aren’t necessarily seven. I often put the question to other musicians, especially composers, in order to sound out their thinking. This morning I asked my student Marie, a gifted pianist and a promising composer, why there are seven tones in our scales. “Because there are seven planets,” she said.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">“I thought there were nine,” I replied.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">“Those two don’t count.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">“OK, let’s include seven heavens and seven days of the week. Maybe seven is just an inherently attractive number, and the same quality that makes it attractive to an astrologer or a philosopher also makes it useful to a musician. But that doesn’t answer my <em class="calibre3">why</em>: Why are there seven tones?”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">“When we’ve both died and we’re <em class="calibre3">on</em> the seventh planet, then you’ll get it.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I laughed. She’s right, of course. But that doesn’t help me now.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The most usual musical explanation is the Pythagorean one, which states that seven tones come naturally from the spine of fifths. If you begin with the tone F and go up by fifths you will get F–C–G–D–A–E–B. Octave-reduced and beginning on C, these make a seven-tone scale with amazing properties. There are, for instance, only two kinds of scale steps: 9:8 whole steps and 256:243 half steps. (Remember, this way of deriving the scale is different from what we’ve been practicing so far in this book.) Also, the upper tetrachord is an exact transposition of the lower. This scale (and other three-limit scales derived by octave-reduced triplings only) have been theoretical favorites ever since the dawn of music theory, possibly because of the conceptually attractive procedure of deriving an entire musical language from the lowest, hence purest, generative prime. But the objection to the theory that the three-limit, Pythagorean system generates seven tones is that, when you allow five-limit or seven-limit systems into the mix, the resulting seven-tone scales are just as convincing. So even though the problem has a specific and elegant Pythagorean elaboration, it doesn’t have a general Pythagorean solution. We still need an answer that covers all cases, including our own extra-Pythagorean music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The present discussion has been framed by a question about “our” music of seven tones, but it may be timely to point out that much of the music of the present world, and most of the music of the historical world, is pentatonic—that is, made up of five-tone scales. Even at this late date, five-tone music probably covers just as much surface area of the globe as seven-tone music. Many Western trained musicians, with a kind of musical colonialism, think that five-tone scales are just seven-tone scales with two tones missing—a primitive version of their own more highly evolved modes. But when you listen openly to true pentatonic music, each mode creates a complete universe. Some of the most intricate and challenging of the North Indian <em class="calibre3">ragas,</em> for instance, are pentatonic. The complex rhythmic structures of African music are supported by pentatonic scales. The Balinese have invented unique pentatonic tunings that permanently alter the mind. Love songs to man and god are driven to the limits of the psyche in five tones over half the world. We haven’t said much in this book about pentatonic scales because our central question involves the behavior of tonal harmony in twelve-tone equal temperament, a harmony that is essentially heptatonic and triadic. But the subject is ancient, vast, and fascinating.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">And what about six-tone scales? And eight- and nine-tone scales? They all exist. These considerations all combine to reinforce the mystery of why seven-tone scales sound so right to us. Now let’s ask an even tougher question.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">What Is a Degree?</p>
        <p class="ctx">The issue may be further focused by asking, What is a degree? A rung of a ladder is easy to find: It is where your full body weight is supported, where your foot comes to rest, where it stops falling, where it belongs. There are a given number of rungs in a ladder. Are there a given number of places where your voice stops?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As a young child I was slow at developing pitch sense. I remember being in nursery school (age four) and having a hard time keeping up with the singing of the class—sometimes the sounds simply didn’t make sense. One day when I was absent, the teacher taught the class “Eensy Weensy Spider” (replete with the finger dance), which, lest ye forget, goes like example 14.2.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The next day, the whole class knew “Eensy Weensy Spider” and I did not. “You just listen,” said the teacher, and I did, apprehensively. Later, during recess, I found myself at the drinking fountain alone and unwatched, and I performed the finger dance of “Eensy Weensy Spider” on the real fountain spout while singing the tune, which, to my surprise, I remembered. The instant is acrylic in my memory: I am standing at the little kids’ fountain; its worn brass spout is glistening in the sun. I am transfixed by the clarity of the melody I have just heard myself singing. Without moving my eyes from the dazzle of the sun on the spout, I hear wordlessly in my mind’s ear:</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The tones in my mind are blazing horizontal lines, perfectly positioned. “There are three <em class="calibre3">places</em>,” I think, and hear the melody again. “Three places for my voice to go,” and the whole playground is lit gold with my happiness. That was the moment I discovered degree, and over the years I have accepted seven as the magic number of them, along with the rest of us. After fifty years of singing scales, however, including twenty-five of <em class="calibre3">raga,</em> the magic number has begun to wobble. The Indian construct is, like ours, seven tones, but there are circumstances in <em class="calibre3">raga</em> where the seven-tone condition evaporates. In many <em class="calibre3">ragas</em> the augmented prime—C<span class="fon">#</span> to C (specifically, 25:24)—is a scale tone called <em class="calibre3">re</em>; that is, it is treated as though it were the second scale degree. But correctly named according to its harmonic nature, that tone is truly C<span class="fon">#</span>, a “chromatic” version of the tonic. Likewise the augmented fifth, G<span class="fon">#</span> (25:16). (These tones are discussed in detail in chapter 16.) Since C and G themselves never go away, we now have seven degrees according to the <em class="calibre3">sargam</em> but, according to the harmony, only five different letter names plus two chromatic pairs. The technical reason for this is that the letter names are generated by a three-limit system, and their utility becomes compromised in the pentamerous dimension, which, of course, we use often and liberally. So the concept of seven tones appears to spring leaks, especially beyond the confines of the Pythagorean system. If you can’t trust the seven-degree construct, you can’t trust any of the nomenclatures that are derived from it. So, back to square one: What is the principle behind seven tones?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">All we can say, I believe, is that most of Earth’s music is in either five or seven tones, that heptatonicism seems to be a most useful convention even if it leaks, and that there doesn’t seem to be a general theory (not even mine) to account for our responses.</p>

        <p class="csht">Terminology Check</p>
        <p class="ctx">In light of our present knowledge and ignorance, then, let’s review the names we use to identify our place in musical space.</p>
        <ol class="calibre6">
          <li value="1" class="calibre13"><em class="calibre3">Letter names</em> (A, B, C) specify notes but imprison you in the seven construct; when you run out of letters you have to begin again using sharps or flats.</li>
          <li value="2" class="calibre13"><em class="calibre3">Degree names</em> (tonic, supertonic, etc.) ascribe diatonic function—that is, the character of the work done, or the niche occupied—to a degree (e.g. “dominant”). But, as we have already mentioned (chapter 7), these names are inconsistent and, of course, limited to the seven construct they describe.</li>
          <li value="3" class="calibre13"><em class="calibre3">Intervalic names</em> (unison, second, third, etc.) measure the number of scale degrees between two tones, but their usefulness ends there. They are limited by the seven construct, and they do not take into account the harmonic generation of tones. The problem isn’t their limitation but their overuse. When you measure musical meaning by linear names, the greater, harmonic dimension becomes obscured. Overuse of intervalic names is a direct result of the loss of harmonic understanding in our music making and teaching.</li>
          <li value="4" class="calibre13"><em class="calibre3">Interval modifiers</em> (perfect, major, minor, augmented, and diminished) are adjectives that modify interval names. <em class="calibre3">Perfect</em> hints at harmonic derivation (perfect intervals are three-limit only: primes, octaves, fifths, and fourths); otherwise <em class="calibre3">major</em> and <em class="calibre3">augmented</em> simply mean “the large (or larger) kind” and <em class="calibre3">minor</em> and <em class="calibre3">diminished</em> mean “the small (or smaller) kind” of scale distance.</li>
          <li value="5" class="calibre13"><em class="calibre3">Ratios</em> are the only absolute and precise names for relationships between tones. They ascribe no diatonic function; in fact, they avoid any scale construct whatsoever. Furthermore, they code for the generating tone: Factoring reveals the harmonic path from the source. But sometimes they have too much detail and become rapidly unwieldy when tracking the relationship of melodic tones to one another (rather than to the tonic). Also, the farther away from the tonic you get, the larger and less decipherable the numbers become. Finally, although all the above names break down sooner or later in equal temperament, ratios, thanks to their precision, break down soonest (as we shall see).</li>
          <li value="6" class="calibre13"><em class="calibre3">Solfege</em> and <em class="calibre3">sargam</em> syllables, although based on the seven construct, are geared toward making that construct automatic while concentrating on pure sound, and thus are welcome to the singer. One could, however, devise a system of syllables based on ratio alone. 10:9 could be

        <p class="csht">Treating Names as If They Were True</p>
        <p class="ctx">There are many ways of making ladders—not too many rungs, not too few, with the rungs not too close together and not too far apart. There are likewise many ways of making scales; the seven-tone model, although obviously not the only one, is nevertheless extremely useful. For now it is to our advantage to treat the naming systems that arise from the seven-tone scale as if they were true. But we must remember that they are not quite true. It is crucial to understand the limitations of the names we use. The half truth of a construct in the mind can actually close our ears to the truth of a sound in the air. Incomplete or false constructs may lead us away from the subtlety we seek. Eventually, thanks to our enhanced harmonic experiences and our nimbleness with ratios, we will indeed witness the borders of the heptatonic system becoming permeable, but from now on we will have been forewarned, and prepared for imminent wobbles and collapses. We will understand and adjust. Meanwhile, we will opportunistically make some practical musical distinctions based on the seven-tone model. These distinctions are the focus of the next chapter.</p>

        <p class="csht">Diatonic versus Chromatic Half Steps</p>
        <p class="ctx">There are two kinds of half steps in our twelve-note lattice. One kind has adjacent letter names, for instance, E to F, F<span class="fon">#</span> to G, G to A<span class="fon">b</span>. These are called, in a broad use of the term, <em class="calibre3">diatonic,</em> meaning that they proceed from one scale degree to the next. The other kind of half step is spelled with same-letter names, for instance E<span class="fon">b</span> to E<span class="fon">n</span>, A<span class="fon">b</span> to A<span class="fon">n</span>, F<span class="fon">n</span> to F<span class="fon">#</span>. These are generally called <em class="calibre3">chromatic,</em> meaning that the scale degree does not change even though its position is adjusted. The ladder-and-rung model of chapter 14 will be useful again here. Let seven rungs of a ladder correspond to the seven diatonic degrees of a scale. Rungs one and five are fixed in position, but the other five rungs each have a high notch and a low notch. There are thirty-two possible rung arrangements (corresponding to the thirty-two available modes) with this type of ladder, as we have seen. But there is another way you can use this ladder: You can adjust the height of a rung <em class="calibre3">at the same time that you are standing on it.</em> This presents a huge increase in the number of strategies for moving up and down the ladder.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In musical terms, the moving rung is a chromatic half step, and it allows our modes—or moods—to be enriched with a deeply felt harmonic motion. How can one distinguish musically between stepping to the next rung (a diatonic half step) and moving the rung itself (a chromatic half step)? Is it a real distinction, or merely a result of the ephemeral seven-tone construct? Who rungs these ladders, anyway, and who drills their notches? We can frame such questions and suggest ways of working them out, but the real answers, the musical answers, can come only from each person’s experience. Personally I find the formal distinction between diatonic and chromatic half steps real enough to be extremely useful in learning modal music, and even more so in applying the experiences of just intonation to the understanding of equal-tempered harmony.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-562" class="calibre1"><p class="csht" id="calibre_link-109">Major and Minor Thirds</p><p class="ctx">In the course of our modal study, we have already discussed all seven of the diatonic half steps available in the lattice of twelve notes. Let’s now examine the five available chromatic half steps and explore their qualities. The most familiar chromatic half step is from the minor third degree of a scale to the major third degree—E<span class="fon">b</span> to E<span class="fon">n</span> in the key of C. It is familiar because we conventionally divide all our scales into two types, Major and Minor, depending on the state of the third. Consequently we train early to distinguish between major and minor thirds. Thinking melodically, the difference between the two thirds depends on their distance up from the tonic. Thinking harmonically, however, the difference is a question of the directionality of the generating major third: To derive “major” you go <em class="calibre3">up</em> a major third from the tonic; to derive “minor” you go <em class="calibre3">down</em> a major third from the dominant. The “interval of the minor third” between C and E<span class="fon">b</span> is what is left over after deriving E<span class="fon">b</span> from G; it is a secondary result, not a primary harmony. Although, as we have just discussed, it is not intellectually obvious why we hear both E<span class="fon">n</span> and E<span class="fon">b</span> as being the third degree of the scale, we typically do, so the assignation of same-letter names and the designation “chromatic” are both appropriate.</p><p class="calibre5">Observe that the harmonic path from E<span class="fon">b</span> to E<span class="fon">n</span> is (starting from E<span class="fon">b</span>) up a third to G, down a fifth to C, and up a third to E, or a total of up two thirds and down a fifth, as in figure 15.1.</p><p class="img"><img src="000178.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"> <b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 15.1</em></b></p>

As thirds stack up, the mind tilts.</p><p class="calibre5">Non-Western musicians the world over love major/minor pairs and use them freely for heightened intensity of feeling. But when Western music began to temper its scale, the affective difference between diatonic half steps and chromatic half steps became so diluted that it was all but lost. To make matters worse, as the use of equal temperament became more common, major/minor pairs began to be misspelled. Incorrectly spelled notes (e.g., a written D<span class="fon">#</span> when an E<span class="fon">b</span> is intended) are rare or nonexistent in pre-Bach music, and in all of Bach’s enormous output of written works I do not know of one spelling error. The man tuned his own instruments. He knew what key he was <em class="calibre3">in</em> and what degree he was <em class="calibre3">on,</em> and in cases of ambiguity he chose judiciously. But in the following generation, guess what happened. By 1780, misspellings were common, and Herr Mozart was as sloppy (gasp!) as anyone. Example 15.3 is a typical Mozartean misspelling. It is from the Sonata in B<span class="fon">b</span>, K. 570, bars 14–16, which I’ve transposed to C for consistency with this discussion. Properly spelled, the passage would read as in example 15.4.</p><p class="calibre5">Yes, I can see how the great new market of bourgeois music buyers, and the publishers who serviced them, did not want to see rows of accidentals on the page; diatonic steps were thought easier than chromatic steps to read. But we can pinpoint right here the loss of precious musical subtlety, which was to continue over the ensuing centuries. Consider the phrase in example 15.5, in Mozart’s original spelling, from Sonata in F, K. 332 (bars 49–51).</p><p class="img"><img src="000182.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"> <b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 15.3</em></b></p><p class="img"><img src="000183.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"> <b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 15.4</em></b></p><p class="img"><img src="000184.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"> <b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 15.5</em></b></p><p class="ctx">Now consider the phrase with its spelling indicating the generating harmony (example 15.6).</p><p class="img"><img src="000185.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 15.6</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">A beautiful new dimension is restored, one that I would wager was in Mozart’s ear all along, temperament and spelling be damned.

Can you (honestly) hear a D<span class="fon">#</span> over a C drone—that is, truly in the key of C—as a raised second without it either becoming a minor third in your head (in which case it is E<span class="fon">b</span>), or modulating to E Minor? I think the D<span class="fon">#</span> in this harmonic context is simply a wrongness, albeit a convenient kind of wrongness, a kind that appears increasingly as equal temperament becomes the European norm. Such misspellings intersect with other problems of nomenclature, rendering tonal harmony a difficult subject to learn and teach—one feels one has to machete one’s way through a twisted thicket of wrong names. Nonetheless, we have opportunistically caught the culprit in the act: an early example of a great master who, at the very moment of composing a deathless phrase, strips away from its nomenclature the reciprocity of its major/minor play. Zooming out now with a wide-angle shot, we view an entire continent, preoccupied with modulation and its pleasures, looking on with passive consent.</p><p class="calibre5">Let’s not carry the plot too far too soon, however.

        <p class="csht">Major and Minor Sevenths</p>
        <p class="ctx">In our lattice of twelve notes there are two other major/minor pairs that behave more or less the same way the third-degree pair does. The seventh-degree pair, B<span class="fon">b</span> and B<span class="fon">n</span>, lies between the fifth G to D; the sixth degree pair, A<span class="fon">b</span> and A<span class="fon">n</span>, lies between the fifth F to C. Both are likewise (reckoning from the lower tone of the chromatic pair) up a third, down a fifth, up a third; their harmonic path again looks like figure 15.1. B<span class="fon">n</span> down to B<span class="fon">b</span> is 25:24; likewise, A<span class="fon">n</span> down to A<span class="fon">b</span> is 25:24. All three major/minor pairs flip pentamerous energy the same way, with commensurate <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> results. The difference is simply where each pair lives in respect to the tonic.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">B<span class="fon">n</span> and B<span class="fon">b</span> are both relatively dissonant against the tonic. The B<span class="fon">n</span> leads nicely—but definitely not necessarily—upward to C. B<span class="fon">b</span> leads nicely down to either A<span class="fon">n</span> or A<span class="fon">b</span>, but not necessarily to either. Great beauty lies in the juxtaposition of the two sevenths. Example 15.9 is a typical use.</p>

It seems, during such moments, that complementary states of the psyche are indeed conjoined.

      <p class="ctx">OUR FIELD OF MUSICAL POSSIBILITIES is about to expand again, but I don’t want you to feel overwhelmed by a barrage of new tones. Rather, let this chapter serve as an exploratory survey and as a reference for the future. The material on just intonation is supplemented by the “Glossary of Singable Tones” in the back of the book and by the discussions of equal temperament in parts 2, 3, and 4. The work of learning the various harmonic qualities will occur naturally over time, the way tumbling stones make each other smooth.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-117" class="calibre1"><p class="csht">Cents</p><p class="ctx">To cope with the widening range of tones, we need a precise system of measurement—one with a very small unit of measure. To follow the conventional scientific method, we begin with the twelve-tone equal-tempered scale, which by definition divides the octave into twelve equal semitones. Each semitone is then further divided into one hundred equal parts, each of which is called a <em class="calibre3">cent.</em> There are thus one hundred cents in an equal-tempered semi-tone and twelve hundred cents in a full octave. A cent is a very small unit indeed—a pitch variation of one cent is virtually undetectable by human ears. A variation of two cents, however, can be heard as a change of pitch and can be felt harmonically. Since the end of the nineteenth century the cent has been the standard measurement of musical interval used by acousticians, and in recent times it has been generally adopted by musicians as well.</p><p class="calibre5">Although the use of cents as a measurement is useful and benign, it is important to understand the fundamental differences between cents and the low-prime ratios we have been using. A critical difference is that equal-tempered tuning is cyclic and just intonation is not. Cyclic intervals stack up to an octave. If you stack up twelve equal-tempered semi-tones, they will, by definition, add up to an octave—that is what they were invented to do. In a sense, there <em class="calibre3">is</em> only one interval in equal-tempered tuning, and that is the semitone. Everything else is stacked semitones. An equal-tempered whole step is two stacked semi-tones, and six of them make an octave. Four stacked minor thirds (each made of three semi-tones) make an octave; three stacked major thirds (each made of four semitones) make an octave; twelve stacked fourths (five semitones) make five octaves, which reduce to an octave; two tritones (six semitones) make an octave; twelve stacked fifths (seven semitones) make seven octaves, which reduce to an octave; and so on. On the other hand, apart from the octave itself, <em class="calibre3">no</em> just interval stacked <em class="calibre3">any</em> number of times will <em class="calibre3">ever</em> make an octave. How can this be?</p><p class="calibre5">A little mathematical common sense will help to understand this. Since an octave is a doubling of the frequency, “making” or “coming back to” an octave means you have multiplied your original frequency times two, or by some power of two. When you generate tones by pure perfect fifths you triple the frequency (and then octave-reduce, which we will omit for now). Three is a prime number, of course, which means it is not divisible by any other whole number. It means also that when you multiply three times itself any number of times, the resulting number is not divisible by any other whole number except some other three-generated number. For instance, no power of three is ever divisible by two. (Is 9 divisible by 2? Is 27? Is 81? 243? 729? Try some more.) That means you can stack pure perfect fifths until the end of time and never come back to any octave of your starting place. The same is true in respect to pure major thirds, which are quintuplings (in reduced form). No power of five is divisible by two. No number of stacked pure thirds (5:4) will ever make any octave of the generating tone. Same with septuplings. Same with any prime-generated tone. Prime-generated tones are not cyclic; they don’t come ’round. Just intonation doesn’t make circles; it radiates outward from its center until the ear gives up. It’s not closed like a dome; it’s open like a prairie.</p>
<p class="p">    The prime-number ratios we have been using so far represent the pure harmonies of just intonation, our responses to which, to some degree, define our humanity. Cents, on the other hand, were thought up as an arbitrary unit of measure. They were devised so that 1200 of them will stack up to make an octave, which means that if you multiply a cent’s ratio times itself 1200 times you will get a doubling, or 2:1, or simply 2. Now, what number multiplied times itself 1200 times gives 2? The answer is this: a very small irrational number. Irrational numbers cannot be expressed in terms of whole numbers. The ratio of one cent to the number 1 is <span class="formula"><span class="sqrt"><sup class="root">120</sup><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="root1">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>:1, or “the 1200th root of 2 to 1”; its approximate ratio to 1 in decimal numbers is 1.0005777895:1. Remember, this is an inaudibly small interval.</p>
<p class="p">    Now let’s consider audible intervals. The ratio of the equal-tempered D<span class="fon">b</span> to C is the irrational <span class="formula"><span class="sqrt"><sup class="root">12</sup><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="root1">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>:1, but the interval measurement in cents is 100 even. Conversely, the ratio of the just D<span class="fon">b</span> to C is the rational 16:15, but that interval expressed in cents is the irrational 111.731 . . . cents. Because they are grounded in irrational numbers, cents as a measure of prime-number ratios will always be approximate; nonetheless, they are a convenient means of comparing the various distances between tones. Even though, up to now, intervalic distance has not been our focus, as we proceed with the investigation of equal temperament, symmetrical scales, and eventually atonal music, the deep forces of pure harmony loosen and weaken, and the surface measurement of distance becomes increasingly needed, and cents sufficeth.</p></div>

We’ll begin with the central spine of fifths.</p><p class="csht1">THE PYTHAGOREAN MAJOR SIXTH</p><p class="ctx">The next fifth above D is A, sometimes called the Pythagorean major sixth. Its map is shown in example 16.1. Its harmonic path is three fifths up and looks like figure 16.1.

To learn to sing this in tune, it is best to have a third string so you can tune C–G–D in fifths (with only two strings you could induce the D from the G) and then sing the A as the next fifth. Then sound your new A with C. In respect to the old familiar 5:3 A, the Pythagorean A is indeed new. It is about twenty-two cents higher, for one thing, (that is, 22 percent of an equal-tempered half step); more crucially, it has quite a different harmonic quality. But that quality is an extension of something that is <em class="calibre3">not</em> new to us: If you sing 1:1 <em class="calibre3">sa</em>, then 3:2 <em class="calibre3">pa,</em> then 9:8 <em class="calibre3">re,</em> and then the 27:16 <em class="calibre3">dha,</em> you can hear how the tones generated by pure fifths are a family. Obviously they increase in complexity as they advance along the spine, but there is a binding qualitative thread. In the context of the upper tetrachord shown in example 16.2, the 27:16 A sounds quite natural and is in fact an exact intervalic transposition of the extremely familiar lower tetrachord we have been singing all our lives.</p><p class="img"><img src="000205.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 16.1</em></b></p><p class="img"><img src="000206.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><em class="calibre3"><b class="calibre8">Figure 16.1</b></em></p><p class="img"><img src="000207.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 16.2</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">The 27:16 A, though not as common worldwide as 5:3, is definitely the tone that many people (in China and Japan, for instance) hear as the major sixth degree of the scale. Even though it may sound sharp to some of us, it isn’t sharp, it’s what it is.</p><p class="calibre5">Example 16.3 shows how both tetrachords are the same. Notice the numbers. The lower tetrachord is the familiar version of the Major mode: C to D is a major whole tone, and D to E is a minor whole tone. In the upper tetrachord, G to A is likewise a major whole tone, and A to B is a minor whole tone. A to C is 27:16, the Pythagorean major sixth.</p><p class="calibre5">In unfolding the lattice of pure harmony, the discovery of 27:16 marks a new day. We now have in our language two distinct tones that are very close in pitch and that share the same diatonic function, the same letter name, and the same solfege syllable. They are <em class="calibre3">step-siblings</em>. Stepsiblings share the same domicile but have different combinations of parents. The 5:3 A is <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded, that is, a union of both (reciprocal) <em class="calibre3">pa</em> and <em class="calibre3">ga</em>; the 27:16 A is of pure overtonal <em class="calibre3">pa</em> lineage. The two A’s both live in the sixth degree, but have different harmonic generation.</p><p class="img"><img src="000208.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 16.3</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">It is crucial, when learning a new tone very close in pitch to another tone you already know, not to give in to the temptation of comparing their pitches directly—at least not too early in the process. It would be like comparing a new friend to an old friend too soon. You might perceive that the new one is a quarter-inch taller, but beyond that you must give the new friend’s personality a chance to become known. Once you have internalized the harmonic qualities of both tones, you may find it useful, or at least interesting, to ascertain the difference in pitch. But it is not the relative height of tones that is musically nourishing. What’s vital are the harmonic paths, the resonances they produce, and the way those resonances live in the body.</p><p class="calibre5">Harmony is the way things are together. When a tone is harmonically related to a tonic (whether or not that tonic is sounding in the air), we vibrate sympathetically with that harmony. As the sympathy is internalized, the crucial difference between near tones is recognized primarily as a difference in mood, a change in the light, of the sun/moon energy; that is what grabs us and holds us and keeps us coming back for more—not small differences in pitch. We distinguish the 5:3 major sixth from the 27:16 major sixth the same way we recognize two friends—one may be gentle and generous, the other nervous and edgy.

One could call the Pythagorean E the <em class="calibre3">re</em> of <em class="calibre3">re,</em> or two stacked major whole tones. I practice hearing it by inducing the third partial, D, from the G string, isolating it, then pretending that D is the tonic. Once I am convinced that D is the tonic I sing <em class="calibre3">re</em> (9:8) above that. Then, gingerly, I add in the low C string and voila! the Pythagorean E. It is fair to say that this note, not used much in the West, is hard for us to hear. The 5:4 third is overwhelmingly the third of choice, of course, so if you don’t take special care the 81:64 third will simply sound like a sharp third.

It is about twenty-two cents (yes, the very same) sharper than its stepsibling 15:8, and ten cents sharper than the equal-tempered major seventh, which makes it the highest major seventh used conventionally by anyone anywhere. To learn to sing this one in tune you need at least three, and preferably four strings, tuned by perfect fifths. Some string players use it (or think they are using it) because it seems to lean upward with the urgency of resolution to the tonic above it. But as a standing tone it has its own edgy, complex tartness, like a very dry white wine.</p><p class="csht1">THE PYTHAGOREAN MINOR SEVENTH</p><p class="ctx">We will now continue to extend the Pythagorean spine in the downward, reciprocal direction.

Just as the perfect-fifth dimension of the lattice goes on forever, so likewise does the major-third dimension. The major third above C is E; it is the first overtonal note on the central spine of thirds that defines the vertical axis, the pentamerous dimension of the lattice; it is also the central tone in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spine of fifths that stretches out to the right of it (B, F<span class="fon">#</span>, etc.) and to the left of it (A, D, etc.). The major third above E is G<span class="fon">#</span>; it is the next overtonal note on the vertical spine of thirds; it will also serve as the central tone for a new spine of fifths—the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> spine of fifths, which stretches out to the right and left of it. Let the symbol for the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> spine of fifths be an upward pointing, filled-in triangle, as shown in example 16.17, the harmonic map of our new note, G<span class="fon">#</span>.</p><p class="img"><img src="000228.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><em class="calibre3"><b class="calibre8">Example 16.17</b></em></p><p class="csht1">THE 25:16 G<span class="fon">#</span></p><p class="ctx">The 25:16 G<span class="fon">#</span> is two major thirds up from the tonic; the harmonic path looks like figure 16.8.

(A <em class="calibre3">comma</em> is the distance between two tones very near in pitch.

Not only is the harmony of this tone musically moving in its own right, but it also functions as a chisel that eventually cracks open the seven-stone scale model; so it will become doubly useful. For now, however it is sufficient to let our eyeballs roll ever so slightly as we sing it.

<p class="calibre5">This should remind you of something we have seen already: the ratio between major/minor chromatic pairs. Indeed, if you were standing on the 5:3 A (known as the tonic of the “relative minor” of C) this very C<span class="fon">#</span> would be your pure major third. It thus represents the parallel Major of the relative Minor (A Major related to C Major through A Minor) and effects a kind of modulation when you sing it in tune, further weakening the seven-tone construct. To sing it, induce the fifth partial from C and isolate that by damping out the fundamental completely. Then sing down a fifth to A; then while hearing the A clearly in your mind, sing up a third. (If that is too iffy, tune a string to the A, then sing the C<span class="fon">#</span> to it.) Then add in the C drone and hang on. This tone is about forty-one cents lower than the 16:15 D<span class="fon">b</span> and thirty cents below the tempered semitone. In North Indian <em class="calibre3">raga</em> it is sung at dawn when the sun is just showing itself above the sea.

        <p class="calibre5">Example 16.20 shows the five-limit lattice as it has unfolded so far. Although we have grown spectacularly from a lattice of twelve notes to a lattice of twenty-two notes, it is clear that the five-limit lattice could be extended infinitely in both directions of both dimensions, and that an infinite number of notes would thereby be generated. Already we have the possibility for more modes than there are people alive to sing them. Doesn’t a useful musical system need only a few tones that work well? The truth is that perfect fifths and major thirds acting together do generate a large number of usable tones (we have covered most of them), but only a few—five, seven, maybe nine—are typically used <em class="calibre3">at once</em> in a single musical context. Our dilemma is a typically modern one: We are interested in a lot of different contexts, and we like our contexts rangy and mutable. And since we have only recently learned to appreciate the music of all humanity, it is only natural to feel like we’ve just arrived at a big party where we hardly know anybody. Gradually, however, as the evening unfolds, we begin to recognize these tones as the authentic elders of our own native village, and then the party begins to feel more like home. The rediscovery of singing in tune against a drone is the tool that opens the possibility of listening with world ears.</p>

        <p class="csht">Each Prime Its Own Realm</p>
        <p class="ctx">Each prime number generates its own musical universe. The number one generates the world of oneness, of unity. Its music has one note: itself. The number two generates octaves only—an infinite but musically empty space. Perhaps one could imagine beings from another galaxy who limit their music to doublings only: two-limit music. They dance ecstatically as the full thirty-octave range of their audio capacity is stimulated by blasts from their sound-producing antennae. But for us earthlings, two-limit produces no music, no dance.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The number three generates an infinitely long line of perfect twelfths. To make these musically useful they must be octave-reduced, that is, mixed in with the number two, making a three-limit system. The resulting spine of fifths gives a replete system with as many notes as we can musically use; the four central notes are used by almost everyone.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The prime number five alone generates only a few tones that the ear understands. Even when these are octave-reduced (making a system that is a mix of the primes two and five), the ear gives up after two moves either up or down. Except as a theoretical measure, the B<span class="fon">#</span> three major thirds above C simply isn’t there for our ears, nor is the D<span class="fon">º</span> three major thirds below C. That leaves at best a five-tone scale bizarre to the extreme, as example 17.1 shows.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Now our familiar nomenclature lets us down: Since the seven-tone scale model is alien in this context, letter names, accidentals, and staff notation are confusing misnomers. But when this system is mixed in with the prime number three, the entire five-limit lattice arises, as we have chronicled over these pages.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Seven Realm</p>
        <p class="ctx">What about the next prime number, seven? To learn the unique quality of the seventh partial, simply induce it from the C string (one-seventh of the string length away from the nut, or between the second and third frets) and listen. Try not to compare it with anything; just hear it, then sing it. What is this new energy? It is obviously overtonal, but is it yang? Is it restful or moving? You don’t need to come up with qualifying adjectives, since like any another musical element, this one simply is what it is; but I do want you to hear and sing what it is.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Since there is no dedicated solfege syllable for the seventh partial, Dr. Overtone, for reasons that will soon become clear, hereby christens it <em class="calibre3">blu</em>—not so much for singing as for theoretical identification—and suggests that all compound tones with which it shares energy henceforth be known as <em class="calibre3">blu</em>-blooded.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As the primes ascend farther from unity, they become less functional as musical elements, less able to generate their musical worlds. The prime two generates an infinite number of overtonal and reciprocal tones with no loss of harmonic identity; the prime three generates at least a dozen; the prime five generates four tones, maybe five, before we can no longer track the harmony. How many can the prime seven generate? Is there a <em class="calibre3">blu</em> spine?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If so, it is short indeed. <em class="calibre3">Blu</em> of <em class="calibre3">blu,</em> yes. <em class="calibre3">Blu</em> below, probably. Both my ear and conventional use stop there. But I am not a seventh-partial specialist. The composers La Monte Young and Ben Johnston, among others, have long been fascinated by the possibilities of higher primes, and have trained themselves and others to sing more complex tones, some of which are listed in the “Glossary of Singable Tones in Just Intonation.” The present task is to learn the essential quality of the seventh partial and a few of its compounds.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">You can try singing the seventh partial as part of the “scale of harmonics” as shown in example 17.2.</p>

        <p class="ctx">The seventh partial from C is a B<span class="fon">b</span> thirty-one cents lower than the equal-tempered B<span class="fon">b</span> and forty-nine cents below the 9:5 B<span class="fon">b</span>, which is a lot of cents—about a quarter tone’s worth. Yet both tones seem indeed to function in heptatonic modes as versions of the minor seventh degree.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">You may find that you recognize the resonance of the seventh partial very well, but this might not have been the case in any Western country a hundred years ago. Seventh-partial harmony has long been thought by European theorists to be in fact inharmonic, or worse, demonic, and incompatible with five-limit tuning, and it was consequently banished from the European aesthetic. But the seventh partial is clearly present in the music of many cultures. Toward the end of the nineteenth century something strange and wondrous began happening to American music—the musical legacy of the African-American freed slaves began to mix with its entrenched European harmonies. By the 1920s Americans were hearing jazz and blues redolent with seventh-partial harmonies. By the 1940s the new harmony had become sufficiently ingrained in the American ear for millions of us in living rooms full of families and friends to find it amusing to round out our renditions of “Happy Birthday” as shown in example 17.4. (The ratios are with C.)</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The tag is a send-up of blues harmony, and the subtext is, “We are sincere and truth-telling, just like real blues singers,” but the heavy vibrato is exaggerated and the vital energy satirized. Such is the ease with which we appropriate power while simultaneously (and often unconsciously) denigrating its source. The actual power of the seventh partial fuels the harmonic quality of a music that helped transmute the humiliations of slavery into the hard joys of survival.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To more fully experience the pure tuning of a blues scale, tune a string to F, induce its seventh partial, and sing it with the F sounding. Then mix in the C string. This note is E<span class="fon">b</span>, the <em class="calibre3">blu</em> of <em class="calibre3">ma</em>; it makes 7:6 with C.

        <p class="calibre5">The seventh partials of C and F, mixing with the heart of the Pythagorean spine—F, C, and G—form a pentatonic scale that has woven its <em class="calibre3">blu</em> threads into the design of the West, and on into the ears of the planet, as shown in example 17.6.

        <p class="calibre5">Also part of the blues harmonic language is the seventh partial of G, the <em class="calibre3">blu</em> of <em class="calibre3">pa</em>, an F that sounds beautiful when dominant harmony is in play. Against C it makes 21:16, and resolves gorgeously downward a small semitone (21:20) to the 5:4 third, a musical move found among in-tune singers in styles as diverse as medieval sacred sequences and African love songs. As a standing harmony, 21:16 may be hard for us to hear, but the note is definitely there, twenty-seven cents lower than the 4:3 <em class="calibre3">ma.</em> We will call it <em class="calibre3">blu ma.</em></p>
        <p class="calibre5">We now have a spine of <em class="calibre3">blu</em>-blooded notes—a genuine <em class="calibre3">blu</em> spine of fifths. For purposes of lattice notation, let the symbol for a seventh partial be the same shape as the tone that immediately generates it, but with a slash drawn downward from left to right. Hence a seventh partial generated by a tone in the central spine of fifths is indicated by a slashed open diamond.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Since each prime is its own realm, we also need a new dimension. We have used up horizontal and vertical; now we must go above and below the flat plane of the page, a three-dimensional effect that can be achieved with proper perspective. In example 17.7, the seventh partials are thought to be located above and to the right of their generating tones.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Fascinating musical structures can be created by using third partials and seventh partials while omitting fifth partials. (La Monte Young has honed this principle.)

        <p class="ctx">The next prime after seven is eleven. Its ratio with C is 11:8, and its pitch is almost dead center between the equal tempered F and F<span class="fon">#</span>, a tad sharp of the center between the 4:3 F and the 45:32 F<span class="fon">#</span>.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The eleventh partial shows up naturally in any music using the scale of harmonics, that is, the uncompounded overtones of a single drone, most spectacularly in the Tuva music of Mongolia, where it appears as a colorful passing tone. To discover its harmonic quality, induce the overtone and try singing it for yourself. You may find it elusive. The question of whether the eleventh partial generates a usable spine of its own, and the extent of its ability to compound with lower primes, is beyond our scope for the moment.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If the eleventh partial is rare, the thirteenth partial is almost nonexistent. At 841 cents it sits only seven cents below the quarter tone that splits the major and minor sixth. Some people say they hear it <em class="calibre3">in situ</em> in Arabic music. In any case it is at or beyond the frontier of just tones suitable for our present purposes.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This completes our primary survey of just tones that make up the harmonic template on which twelve-tone equal temperament rests. Before entering with you into the Babylon of equal temperament, I would like to suggest some ways that your work in just intonation can be more useful in music and beyond it.</p>

      <p class="ctx">WE GAZE AT THE CAT; gazing back at us we see our mammalian nature long before it was painted over by civilization. Through our pets we see our ancient selves, the animal as template of the citizen. For the contemporary Western musician, the pure harmonies of just intonation are like animal guides, preexisting patterns of intelligence that shape the sophistications and bifurcations of the modern soul. Singing in just intonation opens up the guide part of yourself, the template of your own hearing. It is an integrative practice that goes beyond music into the nature of vibration itself. When you sing in tune you can go as deeply into existence as you want.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Aside from the interior dimension, there is a historical dimension to singing in tune: You can realize the European legacy through it. It’s like being alive in the fourteenth century in a cathedral or a castle’s great hall. There is also the global dimension. It is powerful, upon hearing the music of strangers from Iceland, Bhutan, Pakistan, Ghana, Egypt, and New Guinea, to recognize the common threads that connect the harmonic resonances of various peoples. This is not personal authority but the collective power of being human. Whether or not you were musically trained, you would sense the power of the harmonic resonances. But when you yourself can make such sounds, you realize the way in which you <em class="calibre3">are</em> this power.</p>
      <p class="ctx"> </p>
      <p class="ctx">Here are some practice suggestions, iterated and reiterated:</p>
      <ol class="calibre6">
        <li value="1" class="calibre13">Make sure your drone instrument is operative and handy and, if you are using the fifths of a piano, as well tuned as a piano can be. Equal-tempered perfect fifths are not optimal, but they are usable. (Equal-tempered thirds will bite you.) Care for your drone.</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre13">The singing of standing tones—sustained tones of unvarying pitch—is good practice if only to constantly reexamine the pure harmonies. This is not an endurance contest. Remember to follow the wisdom of your breath.</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre13">The alternation of two standing tones with one another, <em class="calibre3">ni/sa</em> or <em class="calibre3">ni/dha</em> or 
<em class="calibre3">dha/pa,</em> for instance, safeguards against being mesmerized by one tone. Sometimes contrast with another color brings out both colors.</li>
        <li value="4" class="calibre13">Practicing within tetrachords, or any small field of adjacent tones, is probably the most efficient way to learn musical space. Sometimes you can spend a half hour on one tetrachord without breaking your concentration.</li>
        <li value="5" class="calibre13">One way to heighten your concentration is to construct a mode that is most appropriate to a given moment of practice. To do this, first sing 
<em class="calibre3">sa</em> (against a drone, of course). Then ask, “What kind of <em class="calibre3">re</em> do I want right now?” You choose, for instance, the 9:8 
<em class="calibre3">re</em>. “Which <em class="calibre3">ga</em> is perfect for this moment?” You choose the 6:5 <em class="calibre3">komal ga.</em> Then, say, no question about the 45:32 
<em class="calibre3">tivra ma.</em> Then <em class="calibre3">pa.</em> You sing what you have chosen so far (<em class="calibre3">sa, re, komal ga, tivra ma, pa</em>) and ask which sixth fits your mood. You choose the 5:3 
<em class="calibre3">dha.</em> And the exactly right seventh seems to be the 9:5 <em class="calibre3">komal ni.</em> Your mode of the day—or 
<em class="calibre3">mode du jour</em>—turns out to be MIX/GYPSY MI. <em class="calibre3">Mode du jour</em> is an example of making your feelings conscious and then illuminating them with intelligence and discipline.</li>
        <li value="6" class="calibre13">You can increase your musical certainty by improvising within a simple metric structure—two-bar or four-bar phrases. Start simply: Improvise in C Major for two bars of <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> time.

      <p class="calibre5">Keep track of the beats on your fingers, or however you can. By graduating to longer phrases, less familiar modes, and triple or compound time, you can incrementally develop your musical language. It is a good idea to compose a series of related four-bar phrases that you notate only in <em class="calibre3">sargam</em> letters and then learn to sing rapidly and perfectly. (These are called <em class="calibre3">tans</em> in North Indian music.)</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Figure 18.1 is a composition in Dorian. Notice that a dot above a letter means the octave above, a dot below means the octave below, and the underlined letter means komal. Example 18.2 shows the same composition in staff notation, for reference.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">I would like to add a word about keyboards tuned in just intonation. Pianos can sound fantastic in just tunings, but only an extremely specialized tuner can accomplish this, and such tuners are rare. Perhaps, with a little help from a knowledgeable professional, you can train yourself. Various electronic keyboards have programs for just intonation, and these also can be instructive, especially in regard to some of the material in parts 2 and 3. But for now I urge you to consider how keyboards place the responsibility for the tuning away from the musician and onto the tuner or the programmer. My advice is to be the actual source of the sound, not merely the operator of an ingenious machine. At least in the present phase of your music learning, you need a decent drone and your voice and a pleasant room with a window and a door that locks from the inside so that the pure tones can learn to be alive inside your body.</p>

        <p class="csht">One Foot in Eden</p>
        <p class="ctx">In part 1 we have been singing in the lattice of just intonation, moving from pure tone to pure tone, threading melodies through a honeycomb of resonances. Why would anyone ever choose to leave this Eden? Many musicians who are native to places not yet paved over by Western influence have never left their tonal paradise. For the Pygmies of Central Africa, the Uighurs of Central Asia, the Azerbaijanis of the Caucuses—to name only a few among many indigenous peoples—the primal resonances that connect singer and soul are still alive within their vital musical traditions. Even in certain populations that have been partially Westernized, such as India and China and most of the Middle East, the central culture remains coherent and the musical tunings are still pure.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">By the late Middle Ages, Western European culture had not yet emerged from tonal paradise. Fourteenth-century composers and performers had learned to produce music that was at once entirely in tune, highly melodic, rigorously polyphonic, and harmonically broad in scope. By broad in scope I mean that when mapped out on the lattice, the music, correctly sung and played, would routinely make harmonic journeys outward from the central tone, cover a wide swath of territory, return to the central tone, then range out to another area and return, over and over again, allowing the music to accumulate an unprecedented dramatic range. In doing so the singers typically encountered, over the course of one piece, many more than seven—often more than twelve—different tones in various harmonious combinations. Each tone, however, remained a true low-prime ratio to the tonic, its resonance and quality intact. The composer’s artistry was defined, to some extent, by the capacity to cover a wide harmonic range while unambiguously using an expanded language of tones (chapter 43 looks at a fourteenth-century piece that does just this). Even though some of these tones were very close to one another in pitch—the distance separating a pure major third from a Pythagorean third, for instance—they were nevertheless harmonically disparate, each occupying unique and precise harmonic coordinates. Composers such as Machaut, Landini, and Ciconia were masterful in constructing labyrinthine journeys through the lattice of just intonation. Their elegant style produced a golden age of singing—subsequently lost but recently in revival—that contained an affective magic like none other.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">But by the fifteenth century something had happened. Adam had gotten hungry. His mind had contracted a fearsome restlessness, and his ear, so long content to range near home, had begun to roam beyond the old borders.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-131" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Need for Simplification</p>
        <p class="ctx">As harmonic range increased, the number of notes necessary to express it increased also. As long as musicians and composers agreed to preserve the accuracy of the pitches and hence their affective quality, the new harmonic territory could be vibrated into being. Remember that there was no unifying, viable musical theory at the time—certainly no practical one—that clarified procedures. (There still isn’t, unless this is it.) Essentially people relied on their ears and feelings; that is the way agreements are reached in paradise, and in this case it produced marvelous results. But as harmonic hungers became keener, the singers’ difficulties increased: Yet more pairs of tones separated by small pitch differences appeared, as well as more chromatic pairs. Harmonic leaps became bold and easy to misinterpret, the harmonic labyrinths easier to get lost in. The musical agreements began to be threatened. Three forces eventually toppled the balance: the simultaneous sounding of multiple pitches, an interest in modulation, and the increasing use of fixed-pitch instruments.</p>
        <p class="csht1">SIMULTANEITY</p>
        <p class="ctx">So far, our working definition of harmony has been limited to the ratios that various tones form when combined with the tonic. A larger definition involves how tones combine not only with the tonic but with each other. How those combinations have developed in the West is the essence of its musical history. By the tenth century, tones had begun to combine in <em class="calibre3">parallel organum,</em> Gregorian chant that had been thickened with fifths or fourths and octaves. By the thirteenth century, the three-part harmonies we call triads were commonly sung as shown in example 19.1.</p>
        <p class="img">

          <em class="calibre3">
            <b class="calibre8">Example 19.1</b>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The typical way of combining tones in late Medieval times was through polyphony, a practice that retains the rhythmic and melodic integrity of the individual voices while producing overall harmonic agreement. (Most of us first encounter polyphony by singing rounds, such as “Frère Jacques.”) Since each melody has its own harmonic territory, their combined territories can become extremely wide. But remember that the farther away tones are from one another on the harmonic lattice, the more remote is their harmony. The greater the territory, the less the agreement among the far-flung provinces. Something had to give. Compromise was in the wind.</p>
        <p class="csht1">MODULATION</p>
        <p class="ctx">Modulation is a change of tonic. Dronality is left behind, and the original key becomes a memory of home in the ear of the listener, a kind of longing that is typically satisfied by a return to the original tonic. If the music modulates to a near place on the lattice (a fifth away is typical), only a few new tones will come into play. But if the music modulates to a more distant place, for instance a half step away (not unusual by the nineteenth century), the total number of tones can double or more. Nonetheless, polyphonic, modulating music that stays within certain harmonic limits can be sung in tune by excellent singers, as many modern performances of fourteenth-century music incontrovertibly attest. When the composer exceeds those extremely subtle limits, though, the agreements begin to falter.</p>
        <p class="csht1">FIXED-PITCH INSTRUMENTS</p>
        <p class="ctx">Instruments of <em class="calibre3">variable pitch</em> can be precisely tuned in the act of playing: In addition to the voice, they include stringed instruments with no frets, such as the violin, and brass instruments with slides, such as the trombone. Instruments with <em class="calibre3">fixed pitch</em>—harps, keyboard instruments, fretted instruments—cannot be tuned in the act of playing. The pitches of certain wind instruments with holes (most woodwinds) or valves (most brass) can be somewhat modified during playing, but where the holes are drilled, and how long the valve tubing is, determine for the player the basic tuning. Likewise, the pitches of fretted instruments—guitar, lute, gamba—can be somewhat altered by pushing or pulling on the strings. But generally, fixed-pitch instruments all present the same basic problem: To what selection of pitches should they be tuned? Where to drill the holes? How long to make the tubes (or pipes)? Where to place the frets? And how to design and build the keyboard?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although a singer can sing an infinite number of notes within the octave, many fixed-pitch instruments have only five or seven. Modern harps have twelve, as do modern keyboards. Frets have to be far enough apart for the fingers to fit between them; there is a limit to the number of strings that can fit on a harp frame. Given our ten fingers, as well as our other human dimensions, twelve notes to the octave has become the consensus over the centuries. The first keyboards with seven notes forward and five raised notes in back originated in the mid-fourteenth century, and although many experimental keyboards have been designed and many tuning schemes put forth, that particular arrangement of twelve notes to the octave is what eventually has been accepted and learned.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Two Possibilities within Fixed Pitch</p>
        <p class="ctx">There are two ways to proceed with a fixed-pitch instrument. The first seems rather obvious: Get the limited number of pitches in tune, then make music that stays within the harmonic possibilities of those pitches. This is often done, of course, and to fine effect. But historically, this choice did not satisfy the desire of the Western ear for an ever-increasing harmonic territory. Another choice, less obvious, depends on the tiny differences in pitch between many of the newly desired resonances. Why not tune one string between two tones of near pitch, and let that string <em class="calibre3">stand for</em> either one? Let it be a single approximate (i.e., slightly out-of-tune) pitch that substitutes for both of the precise ones. Is this a ridiculous idea? Considering the enormous delight we take in the harmonic resonances of precisely tuned low-prime ratios, this plan would not, on the face of it, seem to be desirable. But by the fifteenth century, the counter-delights of wide harmonic range, richly woven polyphony, tonal modulation, and fixed-pitch instruments had been long a-borning. The steep price of these new pleasures: the obfuscation of resonance.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It has taken about five hundred years for our modern system of approximation—twelve-tone equal temperament—to be accepted to the extent it has. Many musicians have fought it heart and soul along the way. It has been railed against, despised, and excoriated in many languages, right up to the present time. And no wonder. In twelve-tone equal temperament, only the octaves are in tune, nothing else. The perfect fifths are two cents flat from 3:2, and the major thirds are fourteen cents sharp from 5:4. As far as tonality is concerned, nothing is actually anything. <em class="calibre3">Everything</em> is wrong. Except for unisons and octaves, every event <em class="calibre3">stands for</em> some other event that we are somehow reminded of, but does not actually transpire. How could an entire mega-culture come to have accepted this?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The reason twelve-tone equal temperament has been so generally accepted is simple: It makes Bach and Beethoven and Mozart sing. It renders Ravel and Bill Evans soaring and translucent. It lets Stravinsky and Bartók open us as we have never been opened. At some very useful level, it works.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Before we begin playing the twelve-tone equal-tempered keyboard that is such a triumph of our history, however, let’s consider more closely how we have allowed ourselves to be so amenably deceived.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Approximation versus the Real Thing</p>
        <p class="ctx">The primary concern of this book is the behavior of twelve-tone equal temperament, and we raise a question central to it: Physiologically and psychologically, how can we accept a musical approximation for the real thing? Any answer to this question, at least at the present state of our knowledge, must be subjective, evanescent, and nonquantifiable. Even the terms of the question cannot be rigorously defined. Scientific method cannot save us. We do, however, have ourselves, not only individually but also collectively. By examining deeply our own responses to musical phenomena, we can shed light on our musical behavior. And by examining the music that people leave in their wake we can understand human response on the scale of human populations.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To better explain what I mean by “the real thing,” let’s step outside the musical frame of reference for a moment and use, as an example, the sense we have of what is “vertical” or “perpendicular” or “a ninety-degree angle with the horizon” or “straight up and down.” We all have an inborn sense of the plumb line of gravity; it is part of the nature that made us. This inborn sense functions as an internal norm from which we can discern more or less deviation: We know how to “zero in” on a center we can feel. The internal norm is further formed and nurtured by experience: We learn to walk; to balance our way across logs; we practice ballet; we study geometry; we build houses, internalizing what is “vertical” from the hard world outside. We might call this sense of center that is both given by nature and internalized by experience an <em class="calibre3">inner/internalized norm.</em> Both inborn and amplified by learning, it is an active interface between the inside and the outside world.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What is fascinating, and relevant to our musical study, is how things can appear slightly off the vertical yet be accepted by us as if they were vertical anyway: Telephone poles and streetlamp standards are good examples. Even skyscrapers—those perfect symbols of straight-upwardness—lean a little. On the other hand, consider our response when the norm is stretched beyond our tolerance: Aunt Edith’s painting that never seems to hang quite straight, or the ever-defiant Leaning Tower of Pisa. Things that are approximately vertical still refer to the vertical norm up to a certain point, but where is that point? The same goes for things that are approximately horizontal. How tilted does your bed have to be before you can’t sleep? How flat <em class="calibre3">is</em> Kansas? Given the intrinsic quantum lumpiness of atomic energy, how flat is anything? Do you know what I mean when I say “flat” on account of a norm that neither one of us has ever actually experienced? Is there such a thing as a straight line? If not, how crooked can it get and still be straight? Can a field be square? Can a cookie be round?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">These are the kinds of questions that will become crucial to our study as we step back inside the musical frame of reference.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Low-Prime Harmony as Norms</p>
        <p class="ctx">The pure unisons, octaves, fifths, and major thirds we have been learning to sing function musically as inner/internalized harmonic norms. They are an aspect of our nature, yet we nurture them by study and practice. In order to understand harmony in its fullness, we need to study not only the musical realization of these norms but also the divergences from them that are typical in music.</p>
        <p class="csht1">UNISONS</p>
        <p class="ctx">Perhaps the most perfect unison we can hear in everyday life lies in the midrange of an excellently tuned piano. The three strings that, sounding together, produce the C above middle C (for instance), are about as close to a unison as music ever gets. It is interesting to damp out two of the strings with your fingers, leaving only one to sound, and then to compare that with the sound of all three together. Not quite the same—partly because of minute idiosyncratic differences between the strings. If three excellent violinists play that same C, we also perceive a unison, but the difference between a single bowed violin string and three bowed strings is now quite noticeable because the human agency in the bowing and touching of the strings introduces innumerable small deviations in pitch and tone. A unison produced by three excellent sopranos, even if sung with “no vibrato” and sounding almost like one voice, would have even more characteristic deviations of pitch and tone. What about three not-so-excellent singers? What about the women in the congregation singing the same hymn, but not exactly together? Now, what about a kindergarten class singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” with many stragglers? Perhaps the children are pushing the musical envelope, but the proud parents are enjoying the national anthem with no recognition problem. These examples, which run the gamut from the nearly perfect unison to the extremely rough approximation, all refer to the same norm, that is, 1:1.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I think the reason the piano and the accomplished violinists and sopranos sound so pleasant to us is that it takes so little effort for the ear to recognize the unison. Our sense of rightness is stimulated directly. A keen pleasure I have as a teacher is to witness a student at the very moment his or her musical experience first comes into line with that interior—but previously unrealized—knowledge. I like to teach people who think they are “tone-deaf” for this very reason. During the first moment a tone-deafer is aware of singing a true unison with another person, a longtime hunger is suddenly satisfied by a resonance that floods the senses. There is a tremendous upwelling of connectedness as outer and inner finally and seamlessly interlock.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">On the other hand, it may take considerable effort for the ear to refer the kids’ raggle-taggle singing to the 1:1 norm; indeed, to a Ba-Benjelle Pygmy it might sound like an amusing sort of polyphony. But our hearing contains a cultural recognition that allows our brain to do the work of sorting it all out and putting it back together as a single melody.</p>
        <p class="csht1">OCTAVES, FIFTHS, AND THIRDS</p>
        <p class="ctx">The more complex the harmony, the more the ear tolerates deviation from the norm. Octaves, 2:1, are slightly more complex than unisons and so subject to a slightly larger range of deviation. As all singers know, it is considerably more difficult to tune octaves precisely than unisons because they don’t lock in nearly so easily. However, groups of men and women singing together in octaves can go considerably astray from 2:1 without breaking off relations entirely. It is even the practice of some piano tuners to “stretch” octaves, that is, to tune them slightly too wide, believing that this procedure increases the sonority of the piano; in this case the typical ear forgives the deliberate de-tuning.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Perfect fifths, 3:2, are yet more complex, and the ear will tolerate more deviation in them than it would in a unison. Equal-tempered fifths are two cents flat, which is barely detectable and not entirely irksome; the same deviation in unisons could not be seriously entertained for long. Historically, the most generally accepted temperament before equal temperament was called <em class="calibre3">meantone</em> tuning; it required the fifths to be 5.4 cents too small, which is definitely discernable but was standard practice for generations before Bach.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Major thirds, 5:4, are of course considerably more complex than perfect fifths, and predictably can take more abuse. The equal-tempered third, as we shall study in detail in chapter 20, is still functional at fourteen cents too wide, but it can also be mistaken for the Pythagorean major third (81:64) under certain circumstances. That very ambiguity is a primary focus of part 3.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-135" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Where Does the Ear Draw the Line?</p>
        <p class="ctx">As we go on with our study of tonal harmony in twelve-tone equal temperament, part of our work will be to notice exactly how much approximation we can stand in the more complex harmonies before our recognition of the inner/internalized norm snaps. The point at which we say, “That’s not an <em class="calibre3">almost</em> something, that’s a <em class="calibre3">different</em> something,” will be at the center of our inquiry.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Meanwhile, it can be astonishing to notice how forgiving, under certain circumstances, the ear can be. The out-of-tune pianos in restaurants and nightclubs are good examples. In fact, the sound of a honky-tonk piano with its built-in wailing dissonance has come to represent a kind of uplifting defiance: We can’t afford a piano tuner but we can damn well play good music. I once happened upon a piano that had been abandoned in the damp woods for a year, yet had somehow defied its own disintegration. It was wonderful to play on because, although music was hideously and hilariously distorted, it was still recognizable. For me, that experience was a cartoon representing the truth that nothing manifest is free from distortion. Existence is a piano in the woods.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When you get down close enough, everything is wildly gyrating energy fields anyway. The Sufi teacher Hazrat Inayat Khan is quoted as having said, “If two strings were ever actually in tune they would break,” by which I think he meant that since no two things in Creation are exactly the same, such exactness cannot exist in this universe. Yet even though we live in this world of near misses and second guesses, we hunger all the while for the hidden center that does not move. It is a tough paradox that the unmoving center cannot be experienced in the exterior world as pure, static form. So we need a balanced communication, a resonance, between inner knowledge and outer experience. That is why as a musician you have to know your inner life, which means intimacy with the norms of rhythm and harmony. If you lose the inner sound, the slippery, slidey, hit-and-miss music of our world loses its reference, and the meaning is diminished, and the beauty and the fun go out of it. That is why singing in tune makes the equal-tempered keyboard more palatable: When the inside is clear, the outside becomes navigable.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-136" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Hunger for the Center</p>
        <p class="ctx">I think that one must learn to value the hunger of the psyche for touching the internal norms. The intelligence and cunning with which that hunger drives us to derive meaning from the approximations and illusions of modern life is otherwise hard to imagine. Civilization itself is nothing if not a panorama of sophisticated illusions: Zoos are wilderness, chemicals are food, reality is virtual, and twelve-tone equal temperament is tonal harmony. The good news is that as the century turns there is an awakening to what we have lost, and to our acculturated denial of loss. Wilderness is becoming precious, not expendable; tribal values and rituals honored, not denigrated; and the resonances of pure harmony sought after and taken to heart. In <em class="calibre3">My Name is Chellis and I’m Recovering from Western Civilization,</em> Chellis Glendinning points out the relationship between the individual psyche and the planetary environment: We can’t heal the earth unless we heal ourselves. She puts it on a survival basis and, as far as pure harmony goes, so do I. Using the approximations of twelve-tone equal temperament intelligently and beautifully while at the same time staying connected to the low-prime resonances of its source is a kind of musical survival strategy, an insurance that the hungers of the ear remain consciously nourished and beneficially used, not denied and thus perversely distorted.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-137" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Our Plan</p>
        <p class="ctx">Our keyboard study can be considered an examination of the way in which our norms of harmony are referred to, played with, tempted, seduced, betrayed, violated, and finally transcended in twelve-tone equal temperament. Don’t worry that you will ruin your hearing by listening deeply to the approximate harmonies of the keyboard. No matter how loudly your culture is shrieking at you, you cannot forget your beginnings: Pure harmony is hard-wired. If you are balanced and open-minded in your practice, you can integrate all functional musical systems into your hearing; you yourself can become more integrated through that work.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">All of part 2 takes place in the key of C and demonstrates the entire gamut of equal-tempered harmonic possibilities from one tonic. We’ll begin keyboard practice with musical structures where no harmonic ambiguity is presented to the ear, that is, situations that could be defined by pointing to a spot on the harmonic lattice and saying, with 100 percent certainty, “I am here.” There are three ways the ear gains certainty as to its whereabouts: pitch, degree, and tonic. In chapters 20 and 21 we’ll discuss equal-tempered situations in which there is zero ambiguity of pitch, degree, or tonic. The practices in chapter 23 introduce ambiguity of pitch. Ambiguity of degree enters in at chapter 26 and is developed intensively (along with ambiguity of the tonic) in parts 3 and 4. Thus we will move methodically through situations where the uncertainty and ambiguity are increased until there is 100 percent harmonic uncertainty, that is, situations in which you could be anywhere, there is no map, and the tones have equal tonal meaning: atonality.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This might be a good moment to peruse again the table of contents and introduction to become reacquainted with the overall scheme of the book.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Then it’s time to leap into keyboard practice.</p>

        <p class="csht">A First Glimpse at Equal Temperament: The Overtone Chord</p>
        <p class="ctx">For this beginning work with twelve-tone equal temperament you will need a guitar or harp string tuned to the C an octave below middle C, as well as a conventionally—and recently—tuned piano (for which an electronic keyboard makes a less desirable but serviceable substitute). Review the section “Numbering” in chapter 1 before you begin.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">First, tune the guitar or harp string as precisely as possible to the C on the piano. Then vigorously pluck the string and review the tones in the overtone series in your mind and in your ear until you can severally or collectively hear the six distinct partials of example 20.1.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Reacquaint yourself with the totality of this chord, its simplicity, complexity, and rightness. Then, at the piano keyboard, strike that same C with considerable force, softly adding the five remaining tones onto the chord in a slow, upward arpeggio. Take about five seconds to articulate the entire chord, delicately folding the higher tones into the gradual decay of the fundamental tone, as shown in example 20.2.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Listen for the ways in which the two differently produced chords are the same and the ways in which they are not. Both chords shimmer, but they shimmer differently. Every instrument has its own idiosyncratic resonances and damping characteristics: Tones fade in and out in complex, unpredictable ways. Also, all strings (particularly metal ones, and especially metal ones under extreme tension, like piano strings) have intrinsic inharmonicity, which means that the overtones are increasingly sharp as they climb the ladder.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-501"></a><a href="#calibre_link-421">*12</a></sup> Moreover, the piano strings are <em class="calibre3">deliberately</em> de-tuned: The G’s are tuned two cents flat and the E is tuned fourteen cents sharp. After making sure that the C of the guitar and the C of the piano agree as much as possible, check this out for yourself. The induced fifth partial of the guitar string, to which the <em class="calibre3">very</em> quietly played E of the piano is added, is especially dramatic.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Indeed, the more deeply and closely you listen, the more differences you will hear between the two chords. But if you listen another way, from a certain perceptual distance one might say, there can be no question that the two chords have the same basic functional meaning—the piano chord is a little rough, that’s all. There is, among certain performing musicians who have to come to terms with the impossibilities of tuning their instruments, a tired but tenacious expression: “Oh well, it’s good enough for jazz,” or “good enough for folk music,” or perhaps more recently, “good enough for classical music,” to which I might add, “Oh well, its good enough for Western civilization.” I don’t mean to be cynical—only to point out that historically we have learned to accept the piano chord as the real thing. All of us who have ever enjoyed a Mozart symphony or a hit song have accepted it. The ear knows how to hear the piano chord as the overtone series as surely as the eye knows how to see the lines of print on this page as straight.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">By striking the fundamental C of the piano chord loudly and then softening the upper tones, we have been minimizing the discordances inherent in the instrument. If you play only the top three tones and play them all with equal force or bring them down an octave, as in example 20.3, the impurities are even more prevalent.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">These chords do not abide so easily in the ear; indeed, it takes a while for a pianist to learn to make a piano sing. But even at their most brash, such triads are accepted as the heart of the overtone series. Even though we package them and build our music out of them, it is good not to take them for granted. In its natural state—as a chord consisting of the fourth, fifth, and sixth partials of a plucked harp string, for instance—the major triad is scarcely audible; it twinkles like a star, and could almost be perceived as an aural gate to heaven itself, some ephemera between flesh and spirit. But to tumble the triad down to the lower octaves, to render it in earth colors and de-tune it in the service of our hungers, is to make a servant out of an angel and cloud its face with the hint of a scowl. Historically, the Western ear has indeed made the leap downward from the 6:5:4 combination of pure harmonics to the equal-tempered triad, and used that triad as the basic building block of its harmonic system. As you do the practices in this book you will find yourself reliving this historical leap from just template to equal-tempered approximation within many different contexts.</p>

        <p class="ctx">On the lattice of perfect fifths and major thirds, the three tones of a C-major triad look like example 20.4. To schematically identify the triad, a third line can be drawn; it is a broken line to indicate that it is not one of the two generating axes of the lattice and hence not an elemental harmony. Major triads form an upward-pointing triangle. In the center can be placed the capitalized letter name, as shown in example 20.5.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Given that a major triad is a condensation of the overtone chord and that the strongest harmonic connection is by fifths, consider the construction shown in example 20.7: the overtones of C and its nearest harmonic neighbors, G above and F below.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Awkward as it may be to play, begin with the C chord, then play the F chord, then the C chord again: then the G chord, then the C chord again: left, center, right, center, much like a ping-pong or tennis game (C is the net).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Now let’s turn the construction into piano music by octave reduction, and by thinning the chords to four tones each, as in example 20.8.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The exercise can now be written as shown in example 20.9. Play this until it is smooth. It can be made considerably smoother by tying the common tones, as shown in example 20.10.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The totality of the sound will be better understood, and better played, if you hold over the common tones and listen for four independent voices blending perfectly together, as in example 20.11.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Learn to play this sweetly and seamlessly, as though it were a sort of musical mantra, because, basically, that’s what it is. The energies that govern this back-and-forth musical flow seem soothing and right. It contains a power central to our musical legacy. It is OK to listen to it over and over again.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To appreciate the back-and-forth flow of energy even more, try to hear the notes as if they were being sung, and consider the part of each singer in turn. Consider the harmony of the soprano and the bass in example 20.12.</p>
        <p class="img">

        </p>
        <p class="ctx">In the first beat the soprano is singing the fourth partial of C; she holds that note through the second beat, where it becomes (magically for her) the sixth partial of F. In the third beat it returns to the fourth partial of C. In the fourth beat, by lowering her pitch a half step she sings the fifth partial (octave-reduced) of G. Play the bass on the piano and sing the soprano part in tune (an octave lower for males). Enjoy at each beat your position in the overtone chord.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now follow the alto, shown in example 20.13.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">In the first beat the alto sings the third partial of C, then moves a minor whole tone up to sing the fifth partial of F, then back to the third partial of C, which she holds as it becomes (more magic) the second partial of G, which she holds as it becomes the third partial of C again. Sing this for yourself as you play the bass, again savoring the way in which you are sampling the bass-generated overtone chords in such a way as to move your voice the minimal melodic distance.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Figure out the tenor part in this same way, singing it while playing the bass. The bass part itself makes the best harmony, of course, but the worst melody: all leaps and no steps. For the moment, however, it will be sufficient to rely on the patience of bass singers everywhere.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now play again the ping-pong mantric cadence (example 20.11) at the keyboard as though you were all four singers in perfectly blended harmony.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To bring our ping-pong metaphor even more into the physical realm, think of a rubber band stretched vertically between two points. Beginning at the center, stretch the rubber band to the left, then relax it back to the center, then stretch it to the right, then relax it back to the center. Now instead of the rubber band between two fixed points, imagine a musical string vibrating in slow motion. The string sets up complementary energies on both sides of a central point of rest. This ping-pong harmony we are studying behaves much like the periodic motion of a string. The chordal sequence of its harmony is, in actuality, the result of the combination of many strings sounding together in close agreement, but behaving collectively with the same oscillating dynamic as a single string: back and forth motion through a center. This may all seem a little obvious, but it can’t be too entirely obvious, since it took humankind about a million years to discover it through experience and another few hundred to figure it out and describe it.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This is a good time to ask again, “What exactly <em class="calibre3">is</em> this territory we seem to be moving through?” The subject is a mystery, of course—no one knows objectively what goes on in the brain or the psyche when we hear harmony. But what you can know indelibly is how it sounds to you as a musician: literally, how it moves you. Let your insides move with these chords. Resist “been there, done that” because this harmony is trying to tell you something that no one has ever heard all of.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Whole Cadence</p>
        <p class="ctx">Consider how a drunkard reaches for his bottle: first, too far to the left; then, catching his mistake, too far to the right; then—squinting—just a <em class="calibre3">little</em> too far to the left; finally, success, and a toast. When we are sober, the margin of error is perhaps less, but our perceptions operate on the same principle: We zero in on what we want, not unlike a vibrating string that comes to rest at its center of motion. Harmonic progressions likewise resolve at the center after motion toward either side. A perfect example of this is example 20.14a, an extrapolation from the mantric cadence. It is usually written as in example 20.14b</p>
        <p class="img">
          <img src="000262.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/>

            <em class="calibre3">Example 20.14</em>
          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The F chord is “too far to the left,” the G chord is “too far to the right,” and the C chord is the motionless center. Called a <em class="calibre3">perfect cadence</em> or <em class="calibre3">full cadence</em> or <em class="calibre3">whole cadence,</em> this harmonic formula or some variation of it typically indicates the end of a phrase, a set of phrases, or an entire piece. The word <em class="calibre3">cadence</em> is from the Latin <em class="calibre3">cadere,</em> “to fall,” which is akin to the Sanskrit root <em class="calibre3">cad-</em>and the Greek <em class="calibre3">kad-,</em> with the same meaning. It has here the same usage as the “fall” of the voice at the end of a sentence. More recently <em class="calibre3">cadence</em> has come to mean “rise and fall” as in “the cadence of her speech,” and that is the actual case in a musical perfect cadence: The reciprocal fifth (the subdominant F) rises to the overtonal fifth (the dominant G), which falls to the generating tone C; or <em class="calibre3">ma</em> to <em class="calibre3">pa</em> to <em class="calibre3">sa;</em> or moon to sun to earth; or yin to yang to balance. You call it.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The salient point here is that F and G, either as tones (as discussed in chapter 6) or as triads, are not harmonically adjacent. In a typical whole cadence (as in example 20.14b), the middle term, the C chord, is at first deliberately omitted, forming, between the F chord and the G chord, a musical ellipsis (that is, something left out). The final C chord then becomes satisfying as the event that, central to the others, reconciles both. You leave out something, then you give it back. Thus the whole cadence can be thought of as a filled-in ellipsis.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There is no chance of overemphasizing how important the whole cadence has become to our cultural ear. For over three centuries it has been sculpting the flow of our music, yet its basic wavelike reciprocity has not been well articulated in our teaching. It is up to you to listen for its true meaning and to come to terms with how to use it—and, if you teach, how to open the secret for others. To bring yourself closer to the sound, review chapter 4 (on <em class="calibre3">pa</em>) and chapter 7 (on <em class="calibre3">ma</em>). Then, as you play both the mantric cadence (example 20.11) and the perfect cadence (example 20.14) on the keyboard, try to follow the triangles on the lattice in example 20.6 with your eyes. Imagine that each triangle glows when you play its chord. I think that actually is what happens—according to its many dimensions—to the lattice in the brain.</p>

        <p class="csht">Three-Chord Music</p>
        <p class="ctx">To best experience the balance of harmonic energy around the tonic, write some music using only the major triads of C, F, and G. In the left hand play only the roots at the pitches given in the ping-pong cadence (example 20.11). In the right hand, play only the three notes of the triad, but you may position them so that any chordal tone appears on top. Start and end on C.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 20.15 gives the idea.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">After writing such a piece, learn to improvise within the same framework. Next, compose another exercise using the same rules, but with this difference: The bass may be in any octave. With the sensitive use of rhythm, this piece can be somewhat elaborate. The point is to discover this elaboration <em class="calibre3">as a function of the harmonic balance.</em> In other words, when you find a harmonic flow whose balance pleases you, the melodic and rhythmic elements tend to discover themselves. Example 20.16, a short composition of three-chord music, offers a glimpse at one of the most astonishing aspects of Western tonal music: <em class="calibre3">harmony as form.</em></p>

        <p class="calibre5">Before you write your own, consider example 20.17, which shows how a Major scale can be harmonized using only the triads of the tonic, dominant, and subdominant.</p>

        <p class="ctx">It is not surprising that the Major scale sounds so well matched to the primary major triads, since the Major scale itself can be seen as a stepwise arrangement of the very tones in these triads, that is, the overtones of C and its nearest harmonic neighbors, F and G. The secret to the stability of the Major scale is precisely, in fact, that it is made from the overtones of a central tone and its nearest harmonic neighbors.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">After you compose your best piece, try improvising within the confines of this language. Transpose the exercise to other keys, at sight if you can. Be sure not to sell three-chord music short. A person who is tired of these combinations is tired of music. The mystery in them is as deep as breath. The three-chord matrix of blues, gospel, and country music—even ultra-manufactured pop and rock music—nourishes hundreds of millions of souls, and it is important, especially if your own sophistications have extended your tastes far beyond this central harmony, to stay empathetically tuned to what is most simple and powerful in the musical language.</p>

(This is a good time to review the section on the minor third in chapter 9.) Remember that the primary functions are the perfect fifth between C and G and the major third between G and E<span class="fon">b</span>; hence the line drawn from C to E<span class="fon">b</span> is broken, indicating that it is not elemental harmony. “C mi” is written in the center of the downward-pointing triangle.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">As I mentioned in chapter 9, singing the 6:5 minor third in tune against a C-and-G drone (thus producing a minor triad) was one of the revelatory moments of my musical education—it was like experiencing real musical fire for the first time. Of course I use the equal-tempered minor triad continuously as a composer and performer and suppose it to be, on the whole, a blessing to humanity. But it must be said that the minor triad of equal temperament is not a very satisfactory representation of “the real thing”—much less fulfilling (to me, anyhow) than the equal-tempered major triad, even though the fourteen-cent disparity of the third (too large in major, too small in minor) is virtually identical. Nonetheless, it has clearly come into common and, for the most part, unquestioned usage. Your job is to sing an in-tune 6:5 E<span class="fon">b</span> against a C and G drone, and then listen to what you get on your equal-tempered keyboard, and then come to your own conclusions. The bottom line for the equal-tempered version of the chord is the same as the bottom line for equal temperament as a whole—it works. But in this case especially, it pays not to forget what you are missing. Forgive, but don’t forget.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Since the minor triad itself is more complex and consequently less stable than the major triad, it doesn’t function harmonically quite as well as a chord of resolution. (The ratios of the minor triad are 15:12:10; the ratios of the major triad are 6:5:4). The all-minor ping-pong cadence seems pastel and floaty; the C-minor triad seems less commanding as a center. For this reason, the cadential function of these chords is usually enhanced by retaining the major version for one or two of them. The most usual convention is shown in example 20.22.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Although every one of these eight versions of the ping-pong cadence produces the same yin-yang rocking harmonic motion, each has its own characteristic modal flavor. You will find it truly useful to compose or improvise (or both) three-chord pieces in each version. Never lose sight of C as the tonic. The point is to be harmonically and rhythmically cogent while deriving a soprano part that is as melodious as possible. Notice how your sense of harmonic balance around C shapes the composition. Notice also that it is not only <em class="calibre3">where</em> you are but also <em class="calibre3">how long</em> you remain there that is musically telling. This combination of where and how long is called <em class="calibre3">harmonic rhythm,</em> and of all the treasures of the Western musical heritage, it is the most sophisticated and elaborate. The harmonic rhythm of a piece is its blueprint through time. When you confine your music making to only three root options (tonic, subdominant, and dominant) plus the modal complexity that comes from mixing overtonal and reciprocal thirds (major and minor triads)—as we are doing here—then the generative power of harmonic rhythm can be experienced in a pure state. By composing with only these six chords, you are exposing to scrutiny one of the deepest musical mysteries.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Relative Minor</p>
        <p class="ctx">On the lattice of perfect fifths and major thirds, the three tones of an A-minor triad appear as shown in example 21.1. As in the C-minor triad, the broken line indicates that the harmony of the minor third (C to A in this case) is not elemental, as is the harmony of the perfect fifth (A to E) or the major third (C to E). Like all minor triads on the lattice, the triangle points downward.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Now examine the image of the relative major/minor pair, shown in example 21.2. The tones C and E are common to both triads; notice the symmetry around the line that connects them. In the C-major triad, the fifth is upward from C; in the A-minor triad, the fifth is downward from E. Consider, then, the pivotal function of E: It is the overtonal third of C, <em class="calibre3">and</em> A is its reciprocal fifth. The word <em class="calibre3">relative</em> probably derives from the fact that the modes of C Major and A Aeolian both contain the same tones—at least, on the equal-tempered keyboard.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-502"></a><a href="#calibre_link-423">*13</a></sup></p>

The popular music of Thailand (among other Westernized Asian countries) often slides seamlessly and endlessly between relative major/minor pairs. Try playing the two triads alternately at the keyboard, maybe singing the common E as you play, to increase your awareness of the subtle nature of this harmony.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Twelve Triads in the Lattice of Twelve Notes</p>
        <p class="ctx">The lattice of twelve notes we so patiently sang into existence in part 1 contains the lowest possible five-limit ratios; it is the “real thing” that we will now represent by approximation on the equal-tempered keyboard. If we move carefully, the approximations of equal temperament will not confuse us, our position on the lattice at any moment will be unambiguous, and we will be able to appreciate the affect that comes with the territory. Let’s begin by studying example 21.5, which shows the major and minor triads available in the lattice of twelve notes.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Since we are dealing with triads as units, it is useful to have a diagram 
with the triadic names only. In figure 21.3 the staff lines have disappeared, 
but the skewed axes of lattice notation remain (that is, the figure is in “staff 
orientation,” introduced in chapter 6). This new configuration we will call a <em class="calibre3">chord lattice.</em></p>

        <p class="calibre5">Notice how, in figure 21.3, solid lines connect all the major and minor triads a fifth apart, as well as each relative pair and each parallel pair. Since the connection of a major triad to its mediant (C major to E minor; A<span class="fon">b</span> major to C minor, etc.) is very close but not primary, those connection lines are broken; the same is true, of course, for any minor chord and its submediant (E minor to C major).</p>

        <p class="csht">Matchstick Harmony</p>
        <p class="ctx">Figure 21.3 reminds me of the matchstick puzzles and games we played as kids. As grown-ups, our puzzle will be to create cogent harmony that the approximations of equal temperament do not obscure. Our harmonies must remain so closely connected that their meaning remains clear even though everything is slightly out of tune. Therefore you may move from one chord to another in the chord lattice of figure 21.3 only if the two chords are connected by a line (or a dotted line). There is one rule and one exception, in addition to several guidelines.</p>
        <p class="blockht"><em class="calibre3">Rule:</em> You can move from a chord to any other chord connected by a line (solid or dotted).</p>
        <p class="blockh"><em class="calibre3">Exception:</em> Occasionally you can leap the distance of two perfect fifths if you immediately fill in the chord you leapt over. For example, from F major you could move to G major, providing that C major (or C minor) were the next chord; or from A minor to B minor to E minor. Of all such possibilities, the best ones by far are those that look like perfect cadences, that is, the roots leap two fifths up to a major triad, then fall one fifth down. Leaping <em class="calibre3">down</em> and then filling (G major to F minor to C major, for instance) is OK but not as strong. Certain moves in this leap-and-fill category sound remarkably weak: G minor to F major to C minor; use these infrequently and with discretion. Notice also that from G major to A minor is <em class="calibre3">not</em> two perfect fifths on this lattice.</p>
        <p class="ptop">A basic characteristic of melodic motion—<em class="calibre3">steps are easy, leaps are hard</em>—is likewise true for the motion of triadic harmony. The above rule and exception simply assure that you proceed harmonically stepwise, that is, by matchsticks.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Here are some further guidelines:</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li class="calibre10">Start and end on C major.</li>
          <li class="calibre10">All chords will be of the same duration (two beats, for instance).</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Play chords in close position with the root in the bass at all times.</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Pythagorean harmony (root motion by fifths) is easier to hear than pentamerous harmony (root motion by thirds). Use more descending thirds than ascending thirds; the latter should be rare. (I’ll discuss this at the end of the chapter.)</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Parallel chords (C major to C minor, for instance) are a form of pentamerous harmony and should be used sparingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 21.6 is a brief, unambiguous chord progression.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice how the harmony takes us to the relative minor, canvasses the overtonal third territory by climbing up fifths, then falls by fifths along that spine of minor triads, then cadences. It contains root motions of a total of two falling thirds, three falling fifths, two rising fifths, and an upward leap of two fifths.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Practice this example until it is rapid and legato and you can truly hear the harmonic movement in it without thinking about your fingers. Then try improvising some other progressions within the same constraints using only these six chords.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A contrasting passage is given in example 21.7.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">Notice how this harmony swings down through the territory of reciprocal thirds, sweeps upward by fifths through the parallel minors, and finally cadences with a minor subdominant. Its root motions include four falling thirds; the remainder is Pythagorean. Again, learn to play this so smoothly that your fingers go away and the shape of the harmony becomes vivid. You might also try improvising (within the rules) using only these eight chords—the six reciprocal-third triads plus G major and C major.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now for an even longer excursion, let’s combine these two progressions. Example 21.8 shows the result. As you play this through, be aware of the progressions by fifths, and of the overall surge from overtonal to reciprocal territory. Ask yourself a thousand times: <em class="calibre3">What is the sound of this?</em></p>

      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-153" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">What Are We Doing? The Reason behind Unambiguous Harmony</p>
        <p class="ctx">If you could hear the music we have been composing played in just intonation, it would sound exactly the way it does on your equal-tempered keyboard except a little more sonorous. That is, the harmonic meaning of both versions, their sense of harmonic motion and place, would be, thanks to the precautions we have taken, identical. Our procedures have assured a tonal context so unmistakable that every time we press down a piano key it produces a tone whose unique harmonic coordinates we instantly recognize. Because we have weeded out all pairs of tones separated by a comma (i.e., stepsiblings and comma siblings, such as G<span class="fon">#</span> and A<span class="fon">b</span>), there is no chance of ambiguity, even though the tuning only approximates the just template. The strongest, simplest ratios in their clearest contexts have been chosen. These special lattice exercises produce <em class="calibre3">no-comma music,</em> as close to pure harmony as equal temperament allows: <em class="calibre3">Nonmodulating music with zero ambiguity of pitch, degree, or tonic.</em></p>
        <p class="calibre5">But why do this? The reason it is critical to become familiar with progressions that are not functionally altered by equal temperament is that so many progressions in actual music <em class="calibre3">are</em> functionally altered by equal temperament. A full, precise description of how such progressions deform the just-intonation template is the central purpose of our work, and we are now nibbling at the edge of the issue. But first we must methodically produce from equal temperament everything that is <em class="calibre3">not</em> unique to it. These harmonies we are now playing sound the way they do not because of but in spite of their being in equal temperament. The only difference just intonation would make is a little more color in the cheeks.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The full understanding of equal-tempered harmony depends in part on the fullness of your experience in just intonation. Events that were single tones when we were singing against a drone are now combined into triads whose harmonic qualities are distributed over a wider range (triangular areas, in this case), and whose ratios are slightly disturbed. So keep referring back to the basic act of singing in tune. That way there is hope of wringing some meaning out of our increasingly complex keyboard universe.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In fact, if you have access to an electronic keyboard that allows you to play in five-limit just intonation, or if you know a tuner who can tune your piano that way (the list is short), or if you can do it yourself, then by all means, tune up and take off. If you are actually playing in just intonation, the lattice position of a chord is defined not only by musical context but also by the tuning itself; so you can become more adventurous and experiment with harmonic leaps, for instance: C to Ami to Bmi to Gmi to E<span class="fon">b</span> to D<span class="fon">b</span> to C, or C to Fmi to Ami to Emi to C to Gmi to A<span class="fon">b</span> to G to Bmi to C, and so on. But, experimentation and beauty aside, our present concern is not how to make music in just intonation. At issue here is how twelve-tone equal temperament behaves—specifically, its relationship to the inner/internalized norms of just intonation.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Meanwhile, back at the equal-tempered keyboard, my advice is to spend enough time with these twelve chords that you can hear them reliably in your head away from the instrument. (I think the ideal distance “away from the instrument” is about six feet: close enough to check what you hear and far enough away to have to get up to do so.) Such inner certainty does come with practice.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Before asking you to plunge ahead with further exercises, I would like to amplify some of the guidelines already given. First, you’ll notice that if you play all the chords with the upper three parts in close position, and always move to the nearest voicing of the next chord (that is, make use of all common tones and move your fingers the least possible distance), then you will always end up in the same position in which you began. Make certain that, when leaping two fifths, you take the upper parts (that is, the right hand) in contrary motion to the bass; this will give the same result as if the elided fifth had been inserted. The examples demonstrate this.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Second, you may have noticed one harmonic move that is excluded from our current practice: In these exercises there can be no stepwise motion in the roots, with the exception of the two-fifths-filled-in-immediately rule. For instance, you can’t go from G to Ami (it’s not two fifths on the lattice) or E<span class="fon">b</span> to F (same reason), or G to A<span class="fon">b</span>, or F to Emi. This preserves zero ambiguity. Stepwise root motion, certainly typical of tonal harmony, will appear in due time.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Third, a note about root motion by thirds. Notice carefully the difference between descending thirds and ascending thirds. Progressions like G to Emi to C to Ami to F, or E<span class="fon">b</span> to Cmi to A<span class="fon">b</span> to Fmi to D<span class="fon">b</span>, sound totally familiar and right to us. After all, the most-used progression of American popular music is C to Ami to F to G to C. In these cases, any two descending thirds always add up to one descending fifth: C to Ami to F gets you from C down to F; Gmi to E<span class="fon">b</span> to Cmi gets you from Gmi down to Cmi. Now try all these examples backward: ascending thirds. They are no less functional ascending than descending, but definitely they are less strong, less used, even downright unfamiliar. Any two will add up to an ascending fifth, and ascending fifths are less used than descending fifths. But they do have their powers. I don’t know why ascending thirds have been so typically eschewed, but I appreciate that our ancestors left us a little something untrammeled. It must be said again, however, that root motion by fifths is easier to hear and structurally more sensible than root motion by thirds, or than parallel relationships, which is another way of saying that Pythagorean is simpler than pentamerous, or, to be precise, that the prime three is lower than the prime five. Pentamerous moves can be beautiful, but they are like sudden changes in the weather, and the ear needs time to become acclimated to them.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Fourth, it is important when doing these exercises to keep your ear in the key of C, so that C is the be-all and end-all, exactly as it was in our dronal studies. In fact, these <em class="calibre3">are</em> dronal studies, using triads instead of tones and equal temperament as an approximation of just intonation. But there is no sounding drone; your ear’s <em class="calibre3">memory</em> of the tonic functions as the drone.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">One more thing. These exercises you are writing are not supposed to be immortal masterpieces; they are for learning and then burning. By all means be rigorous, take time, and be as musical as possible, but don’t be too original. For the time being, dedicate yourself to learning this particular musical language, not to making great art. Believe it or not, that’s the sneaky way great art has of getting made.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Here’s one final example of a piece of quasi-music with zero ambiguity of pitch, degree, or tonic. Example 21.10 shows the chords.</p>

      <p class="ctx">THE PRACTICES IN THIS CHAPTER, like those in chapter 21, produce equal-tempered music with zero ambiguity of pitch, degree, or tonic; that is, at all times you can be certain of your coordinates on the lattice of perfect fifths and major thirds. As in chapter 21, these progressions would sound substantially the same in just intonation as they will in equal temperament, only sweeter and richer. The difference is that the music of this chapter takes place within an extended lattice. Theoretically, a lattice extends forever in both dimensions from a given central tone (our central tone is still C). Later in the book we will ask how far out from the center the ear is able to hear without losing its memory of the tonic. For the present we will impose territorial boundaries and precise procedures that insure zero ambiguity. Within these limits, our progressions will have a special luminosity and, even in equal temperament, result in a pristine kind of harmonic experience.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Example 22.1 presents the newly extended lattice of notes centered on C, with its triads named.</p>

      <p class="calibre5">Our new harmonic galaxy involves a total of thirty-one unique tones and forty unique triads. Further examination of the extended lattice reveals that, unlike the lattice of twelve notes, there are now various pairs of pitches with identical names—twelve such, to be exact. Of the white piano keys, only C has no stepsibling; each of the black piano keys has to represent <em class="calibre3">three</em> discrete pitches; indeed, the black note between F and G represents four (two F<span class="fon">#</span>’s and two G<span class="fon">b</span>’s). This generosity of pitches is reflected in the triads. About half of the twenty-four triads (major and minor) playable on the keyboard have at least two possible positions on the lattice; a few have three. (Find them.) Tell me again how only twelve keyboard pitches can do the work of so rich and varied a harmonic field?</p>
      <p class="calibre5">In just intonation, harmonic meaning is derived from both resonance and context. In equal temperament, meaning is derived primarily from context. If the context is clear, the meaning is clear. In these exercises, the context is given by a continuous harmonic path, a progression of connected chords that lead, like consecutive footprints, away from home and back again. The path may meander, double back, or make wide loops, but if every step is present, the path will still make sense. If there is a break in the path, especially if you are far from home, you are likely to get lost. In real music we <em class="calibre3">want</em> to get lost, at least sometimes and in some ways; that lostness is much like the deliberate confusions of a mystery story, where clarity is saved for the denouement. But for our present musical purposes we always want to know exactly where we are, and so we need to insure harmonic continuity. That means no harmonic leaps, no breaks in the path, no missing footprints: matchstick music.</p>

        <p class="csht">Harmonic Journeys</p>
        <p class="ctx">You are about to take a series of journeys through the extended lattice. To guarantee that you always know your harmonic coordinates, follow the rules and guidelines given in chapter 21 for the lattice of twelve notes, with these special reminders:</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li class="calibre10">Be sure to begin and end on a C-major triad, and to have C as the tonic clearly in your ear. Return often enough to a C triad so that C never loses the feeling of home.</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Be especially wary of leaping by two fifths, even when the leap is properly “filled in.” If you do leap, remember that leaping up two fifths to a major triad and then falling back a fifth is best.</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Use parallel modality (C major to C minor, or vice versa) sparingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 22.2 is an unambiguous harmonic journey through the extended lattice.</p>
        <p class="img">

            <b class="calibre8">Example 22.2</b>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Learn to play this example until you can listen to it without thinking about your fingers. Additionally, it may help to make a tape of it (or a sequenced version) and listen back over it many times in a kind of focused trance. As you listen, you will know you are moving—going somewhere—but where? Some gentle but persistent force leads you around; a harmonic wind blows you about from place to place. Here I am over here; now I’m up in the corner; how did I get down here? and now I’m home again (at the first beat of bar 1).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A simplistic but perhaps useful concept is to divide the lattice up into geographical quadrants: northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest. Northeast is then pure Sharpland—overtonal fifths and overtonal thirds combined. The F<span class="fon">#</span>-major triad is Maine; the Pythagorean E major is Long Island. Southeast then becomes overtonal fifths and reciprocal thirds combined: B<span class="fon">b</span> major (the dominant of the relative major of the parallel minor) is South Carolina; C<span class="fon">b</span> major is Florida.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Southwest is pure Flatland—reciprocal fifths and reciprocal thirds combined. F<span class="fon">b</span> major is Texas; Southern California is G<span class="fon">b</span> major and E<span class="fon">b</span> minor. Northwest is reciprocal fifths and overtonal thirds combined: Northern California is the Pythagorean E<span class="fon">b</span> major and its mediant, G minor; D major (the subdominant of the relative minor) is Washington State; and F<span class="fon">#</span> minor (its mediant) is the Canadian Rockies. The central tone C is an open field somewhere in the middle of Kansas—corn as far as the eye can see.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This is crudely approximated, hopelessly Americanized, and terminally silly, of course, but it can be a useful intermediate concept. Now, instead of hard real estate, try to come to terms with psychological states, your own states of feeling. Are there qualities of feeling that characterize the quadrants? To answer this, go back to the simplest acts of singing, to the perfect fifths and major thirds of just intonation and the responses they evoke in their various combinations. Your work is to make that connection in your person, a connection that is, at this stage of our inquiry, still unambiguously knowable. In part 1 we used concepts such as yin and yang, responsive and expressive, moon and sun, and even mothers and cowboys to describe the harmonic states of single tones in reference to the tonic. In the case of triads, we are experiencing the combined effect of three tones sounding at once, and of their relationship to other triads as well as to the tonic. So it is not surprising that these responses are more difficult to pinpoint, with or without words or graphic metaphors. But in composing these journeys through the lattice, that is precisely what I am asking you to do. As you play your way through these progressions you should notice your responses in the same way you might observe your responses to changing colors if you were magically walking around inside a rainbow.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Try playing the progression through again, this time imagining that each triangle on the extended lattice glows (or <em class="calibre3">winks</em>?—no, that is going too far) as it is sounded. Or simply trace the route with your finger. It is not surprising that in Europe the development of tonal harmony and opera developed and peaked simultaneously, since the dramatic potential of tonal harmony greatly enhances the psychological and emotional storytelling of opera. By the nineteenth century, as tonal harmony was being rapidly and thoroughly explored, even the pure forms of concert music had become much more than mere evocations of mood. Many listeners have described the experience of a classical symphony as a kind of odyssey where the listener is Ulysses, braving forth from home on a spiritual quest and encountering changes of fortune. Our goal as listener-Ulysses is also to return, and during the course of a single piece we do return many times. Each time we are relieved but unfulfilled; thus we venture out again and again until finally, older and spiritually enriched, we return home for good.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Another, perhaps less noble, metaphor is the prairie dog. He pokes his head up from his safe burrow, ventures out cautiously, and then, after an exploratory foray, scurries back home. In each successive excursion he travels longer and farther before he runs back to his haven. In this way he eventually covers his range and will find the prairie grass he needs in order to return home, well fed, to sleep.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now let’s look more closely at example 22.2, using the lattice in example 22.1 as a map. The first two bars swing north to overtonal thirds (relative minors) clear up to B major (invoking the tone D<span class="fon">#</span>). The G of bar 3 falls back to the Pythagorean spine one move east of the tonic (the dominant, of course) but then dips below the Mason-Dixon Line (so to speak) to the parallel minors, then to G again in bar 4, which dips again to G minor. We then take the Pythagorean Express down to the D<span class="fon">b</span> major of bar 5; then back through old territory all the way past G to D major, a fifth higher in that realm than we’ve yet been; then back again through old territory to the F<span class="fon">#</span> major in bar 8, a fifth higher in <em class="calibre3">that</em> realm then we’ve yet been (invoking the outré tone A<span class="fon">#</span>). Now we cautiously come back to the A minor of bar 10, again where we’ve been before, but then immediately we explore new reciprocal space: due west to the B<span class="fon">b</span> major of bar 11, then south to B<span class="fon">b</span> minor. We then revisit F major, hurry home briefly, on to the dominant and then home to stay (on the first beat of bar 1).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice how many of the moves are by fifths (about three out of four), some of them using the centering aspect of cadential energy (the C minor of bar 4, the G major of bar 7, the B minor of bar 9, the final C major). There are no leaps of two fifths, so our progression is, harmonically speaking, entirely stepwise. Notice also the several returns to the tonic triad (C minor as well as C major, in this case).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now compose several such exercises for yourself—at least three separate progressions. Take your time to complete, learn, analyze, and internalize each exercise. Be patient—several hours on one exercise is not unusual. It is OK to spend several weeks on this chapter. Remember that the deepest musical perceptions can be brought forward by knowing internally <em class="calibre3">how</em> you are feeling and at the same time knowing <em class="calibre3">what</em> you are hearing as you traverse the quadrants of unambiguous harmonic progressions. Be the conscious hero or heroine of your own harmonic odyssey. That is how to learn the subject.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Here are some more examples for study purposes. Example 22.3 doesn’t travel as far as example 22.2, but it uses more relative/parallel energy. Centering-by-fifths energy is used twice only, the first time involving the cadential leap of two fifths up followed by one down: Dmi to E to Ami in bars 11–13; the second time is at the end: F to C to G to C (on the repeat). After an initial swing south, this progression is almost completely northwestern. Notice also that I have allowed longer rhythmic values at phrase endings.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 22.4 begins on a C-minor triad, which is already pointing south, and then stays almost entirely southern (except for G major), extending all the way to the (current) reciprocal-third boundary of D<span class="fon">b</span> minor. Unlike example 22.3, it travels a long distance in a short time, but—also in contrast to example 22.3—it has very strong fifth-centering energy: around C minor and also E<span class="fon">b</span> minor.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We have already pointed out that, generally speaking, motion along the <em class="calibre3">pa</em> spines is much more fluid than motion involving the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spines. As an experiment to bear this out, compare</p>

        <p class="ctx2">Obviously, the energy of perfect fifths is easier to hear and understand than the energy of major thirds. East-west travel is relatively unrestricted, so to speak, but one can never be too cautious in traveling north-south.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">You may also have noticed that these examples have an even number of bars, which makes it easier to balance the harmonic rhythm.</p>

        <p class="csht">Harmonic Balance</p>
        <p class="ctx">These progressions could be considered little essays in harmonic balance. What we are balancing is the energy of perfect fifths and major thirds, packaged up in triads, and set in motion around a given central tone. The harmonies seem to have an intellectual clarity as well as a psychological effect. What underlies both is the hunger for home.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The hunger for the center is the composer’s open secret. Like the fear of death and the love of life, it is what everyone feels most deeply yet talks about most indirectly. We have tried to characterize this vitality and to further distinguish between its various flavors: the feelings of the different quadrants. It is interesting to note that the northeast quadrant, which generates the most sharps, and the southwest quadrant, which generates the most flats, are the most-used harmonic areas. They seem to directly complement and encourage one another. The other two quadrants, northwest and southeast, seem generally more bland and difficult to distinguish, and indeed they are used less in actual music. But bland is neither good nor bad in this game. Only balance is good.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-503"></a><a href="#calibre_link-425">*14</a></sup></p>
        <p class="calibre5">There seems to be a historical fluctuation in the popularity of the quadrants. In Baroque times music was tilted northeast, toward the dominant and relative-minor side of the harmonic landscape. In the nineteenth century the reciprocal/parallel world of flats became increasingly enticing, until flats began to accumulate in the collective ear up to high levels. A predilection for the yin, responsive, nourishing grottos of Flatland continues to this day.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-504"></a><a href="#calibre_link-426">†15</a></sup> Your work is to thoroughly and consciously explore the harmonic territory of the extended lattice, and to compose harmonic journeys that are true for you.</p>

        <p class="csht">Adding Melodies with Passing Tones</p>
        <p class="ctx">Once you feel certain that a harmonic progression is clear and balanced, you may add a melody to it, thickening or thinning the four-part texture as you find appropriate. (I like to keep things in three or four parts.) In a way these melodies write themselves. If a harmonic progression is balanced, the melodies inside it are eager to be awakened. As in the previous chapter, be sure to use unsurprising nonchordal tones, that is, passing tones connected to a triadic tone above or below, or stepwise neighboring tones that are harmonically unadventurous. Examples 22.5–7 are melodies to the previous three progressions. Examples 22.8–10 are three more complete progressions for good measure.</p>

        <p class="csht">Where Are We?</p>
        <p class="ctx">We have been investigating the limits of nonambiguity in equal temperament. We have confined ourselves to the stability of major and minor triads and the certainty that results from stepwise harmonic motion through the lattice. Our harmonic coordinates at any given moment have been precise and unequivocal. Yet the harmonic range of our explorations has been astonishingly wide. If the harmonic range of actual music never went beyond the boundaries of our extended lattice, we could now declare the subject of harmony thoroughly understood and fully explained. And indeed, much harmony does indeed behave in the way we have described. But we have most carefully avoided a crucial aspect: the ambiguities that arise in twelve-tone equal temperament the moment our rules are transgressed.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">As we proceed, harmonic ambiguity will begin to seep into our music like ground fog; the paths will cloud; they will fork and loop; we will head east and find ourselves west; we will swear we have passed a landmark only to see it emerging around the next bend. In the throes of your work in later chapters you will probably hearken back to the crisp clarity of these unambiguous journeys through the quadrants and maybe even return for a visit. Meanwhile, you should keep working in this chapter, composing more progressions and learning the ones you have written, at least until you have gained some new experience of the nature of the quadrants and gained some new insight into the harmonic power of low prime numbers.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Beginning with chapter 23 and continuing until the end of part 2, the conditions for harmonic exploration will change. In one way we will go back to an earlier regimen: Our music will be essentially dronal, which means that the drone will always be present (or very close by) so that the identity of the tone in the center of the lattice will never come into question. But thanks to equal temperament, new elements will come into question. Harmonic ambiguities will arise, and as they do we will examine closely our responses to them. Eventually we will discover in those responses the crucial organizing principle of equal-tempered tonal harmony.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="ctx">HERE IN PART 2 WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED PRIMARILY with achieving 
and maintaining harmonic certainty in twelve-tone equal temperament. We have 
employed two powerful tools to accomplish this: the stability of major and minor 
triads, and the continuity of progressions that proceed harmonically stepwise. 
These strategies have given us the ability to take unambiguous journeys on 
equal-tempered keyboards through the extended lattice of perfect fifths and 
major thirds.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Now we’ll change our game and revive an ancient tool to achieve harmonic 
certainty: the drone. From here until the end of part 2 our aim will be to 
explore the qualities and the boundaries of dronality in equal temperament. 
Then, having combined our experience of unambiguous harmonic journeys (chapters 
19–22) with our new understanding of the limits of dronality (chapters 23–26), 
we’ll enter—properly initiated and fully armed—the vast, ambiguous thicket of 
tonal harmony (part 3).</p>
      <p class="calibre5">We’ll use C as our drone and include the G above it; these will pin us to the 
center of a specifically bounded lattice. Although the central C and G will 
remain unambiguous, other ambiguities will be allowed, for the first time in our 
study, to enter in. The drone will serve as a king so powerful that confusions 
and contradictions will be able to exist safely within the kingdom.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Overtone Chord versus the Chord of Fifths</p>
        <p class="ctx">Let’s begin by comparing a new chord with a familiar chord. First, at the 
equal-tempered keyboard, play the chord in example 23.1, which is simply a stack 
of perfect fifths. The harmonic map of the chord is shown in example 23.2. 
Notice how any two tones a fifth apart sound like any other two tones a fifth 
apart; by definition, all equal-tempered fifths sound the same. Notice also the 
effect of the accumulation of fifths. Whatever else they may sound like, they 
never seem to stop sounding like fifths. Now compare this to the overtonal chord 
shown in example 23.3, previously identified (in chapter 1) as the source of the 
just major triad. Its map appears in example 23.4.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Now play the two chords back and forth, as shown in example 23.5. Next 
concentrate for a moment on the sound of the E. As the fifth partial of the 
overtone series we hear it as 5:4, the third of a just triad. As the top fifth 
in a stack of four perfect fifths, we hear it as 81:64, the Pythagorean major 
third. We can actually hear, or imagine we can hear, both harmonic functions. 
But in just intonation, which is the template of our hearing, the latter is 
sharper than the former by about twenty-two cents (see chapter 16). How can the 
E on the piano fulfill both roles at once? What are we hearing?</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The situation is even more confounding when we listen with jazz ears. Example 
23.6 is a stylistic example of the chord of stacked fifths functioning <em class="calibre3">as if</em> 
it were the tonic major triad. The harmonic map of the coexisting possibilities 
of the tonic chord looks like example 23.7. Notice the curved line that connects 
the two E’s, the “stepsiblings” who share the same letter name and the same 
scale degree, but whose pitches, in just intonation, are different.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The Pythagorean third has already been introduced in chapter 16, where we 
also discussed the twenty-two-cent difference between Pythagorean tones and 
their stepsiblings. A minute interval separating two tones is called a <em class="calibre3">comma.</em> 
The stepsiblings we have been studying are separated by an interval called the <em class="calibre3">
Didymic comma,</em> named after Didymus, a musician-philosopher of the first 
century. The pairs of tones we have been calling stepsiblings we now have the 
option of calling <em class="calibre3">Didymic pairs of tones.</em> In part 3 we will quantify the 
Didymic comma in more detail, trace its function in modulating harmony, and 
compare it with other kinds of commas. For now we will accept the map of the E’s 
in example 23.7 as a model for Didymic pairs of tones. Generally it can be said 
that the Didymic comma is the difference in pitch between four pure perfect 
fifths up and a pure major third up.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When we use a single tone on the equal-tempered keyboard to represent both 
siblings, do we become confused about pitch? Do we hear the pitch sliding around 
in some way? If we confine this question to fixed-pitch instruments, I think 
probably the answer is no. After all, a struck string is a struck string; it has 
the pitch it has. Then how could we accept both versions of the harmonic 
function as true? Could it possibly be that a single approximate event could 
stand for two separate “real things”? Could it be that the resulting confusion 
is a <em class="calibre3">positive</em> event, an active ingredient in musical behavior? Could it 
be that equal temperament, the ugly little villain of our tuning history, is 
showing us some especially amusing magic?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Let’s proceed by taking our stacked-fifths-versus-triad method, applying it 
to the Lydian-through-Phrygian set of modes that we have already examined in 
just intonation (in chapter 11), and letting confusion be our guide.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Notice the curved lines that connect the four Didymic pairs of tones: two 
each of A, E, B, and F<span class="fon">#</span>. Lydian is a seven-tone 
mode, and it is played on the equal-tempered keyboard with seven pitches. But 
there are eleven possibilities on the map. Clearly, I can make the keyboard 
sound Pythagorean by playing a stack of fifths. Clearly, I also can elicit <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded 
triads. In actual practice, I can make music using both triadic and Pythagorean 
qualities that merge with and separate from one another like transparent light 
forms. When does the ear hear what? In order to sort things out, let’s consider 
first the strongest triadic harmonies.</p>
        <p class="csht1">TRIADIC LYDIAN HARMONY</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is a property of equal-tempered seven-tone modes that the 
available triads within a given mode sound OK in any order: The triads form a 
permutable set. But within that OK-ness, some progressions are stronger and more 
certain, others are weaker and more ambiguous. Remember that <em class="calibre3">strong, weak, 
certain,</em> and <em class="calibre3">ambiguous</em> are not the qualities that determine the 
beauty of a harmonic progression any more than <em class="calibre3">primary</em> or <em class="calibre3">pastel</em> 
are the qualities that determine the beauty of a painting’s colors. These 
qualities are simply the tools that artists use. Our present purpose is to 
discover the inherent qualities of equal-tempered tools.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In the Lydian mode the strongest progression is C to D to G to C. A Lydian 
melody harmonized using this progression, or some variation of it, might look 
like example 23.12.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Remember, these are studies in dronality, which means you have to keep your 
ear absolutely rooted to C as the tonic, which means you probably have to keep 
the drone sounding. Otherwise you may all too easily modulate to the key of G 
Major, which may be delightful but defeats the purpose of the exercise.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 23.13 gives some perhaps less obvious progressions in Lydian. Since 
the triads of Lydian result from the interaction between only two spines of the 
lattice (the central spine and the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spine), you can observe how these 
Lydian triadic progressions seem to move up and down the lattice along the 
southwest–north-east slope of those spines. One instance, however, is an ominous 
harbinger of the triadic ambiguities to come: When you move directly from A 
minor to D major (or the reverse), the temperament allows us to believe that the 
root motion is a perfect fifth, but our lattice map insists that such a move is 
a harmonic leap, not the harmonic step of a perfect fifth. It tells us that the 
A-minor triad is clearly the relative minor of C (with the drone itself as a 
common tone) and that the D major triad could be none other than the dominant of 
G. So what do you hear when you hear example 23.14?</p>

        <p class="calibre5">This question, and many similar questions that are soon to arise, must be 
considered thoughtfully; however, the answers, crucial to an overall 
understanding of equal temperament, are almost vanishingly subtle, and there may 
well be different answers for different ears. Furthermore, example 23.14 is a 
particularly subtle case—all the more reason to keep both ear and mind open.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The music we are now making is not playable on a twelve-note keyboard in just 
intonation. In just intonation, the A that forms part of the A-minor triad is 
not the same pitch as the A in the D-major triad. It is the equal-tempered A’s 
ability to <em class="calibre3">stand for</em> both pitches that makes example 23.14 playable on an 
equal-tempered instrument.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This is new. The resonances of just intonation are nothing if not specific; 
you can’t make puns in the language of low-prime ratios. So we have definitely 
made some sort of leap from the Eden of just intonation—but where have we leapt 
to? The truth is, you don’t have to come to any grand conclusions about what you 
are hearing right now. Virtually every example of equal-tempered harmony we 
study from this point onward will contain some degree of ambiguity, or, one 
might say, deliberate confusion. But don’t let a little thing like confusion 
confuse you. One develops harmonic discernment only gradually. All that is 
really needed now are open ears and an open mind.</p>
        <p class="csht1">THE LYDIAN MODE WITHOUT TRIADS</p>
        <p class="ctx">Since triads supply a context that clarifies the position of the 
ear on the lattice, one can <em class="calibre3">increase</em> ambiguity by abandoning triads. What 
do we hear when we simply play the Lydian scale over the drone, as in example 
23.15?</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Let’s question the tones one by one. C is given; G and D are clearly 
Pythagorean. E, B, and F<span class="fon">#</span> could be Pythagorean if 
properly fifth-stacked, but suspended individually over the drone without any 
other context they tend to be heard as the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded siblings. The sixth 
degree, A, however, seems to be caught between its two identities. If it 
associates with C and E, as in example 23.16, it can easily sound like the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded 
5:3 major sixth. If it associates with D and F<span class="fon">#</span>, however, as in example 
23.17, it can be none other than the Pythagorean 27:16 major sixth. But simply 
as a step in the Lydian scale, what is heard?<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-505"></a><a href="#calibre_link-428">*16</a></sup></p>

        <p class="calibre5">Notice that there is no ambiguity of <em class="calibre3">degree:</em> We hear both siblings as 
the sixth degree. But we have the option of hearing either of the harmonic 
qualities that the stepsiblings would generate were they precisely tuned. The 
equal-tempered pitch itself falls in between: It is sixteen cents sharp of the 
simpler 5:3 <em class="calibre3">dha</em> and six cents flat of the more complex 27:16 <em class="calibre3">dha.</em> 
Doesn’t the Pythagorean 27:16 <em class="calibre3">dha</em> win, since it is closest? Maybe, maybe 
not. The simpler ratio is compelling. What is this strange sensation that is <em class="calibre3">
both</em> and <em class="calibre3">neither</em>?</p>
        <p class="csht1">POSITIVE CONFUSION</p>
        <p class="ctx">This sense of being caught between qualities is a special state, 
and that state is the primary subject of our search. If, up to now, we had had 
no conscious bodily experience of just intonation, we might not even realize our 
confusion, or at best, it would not seem particularly remarkable. But given our 
experiences not only of the resonances of just intonation but also of the 
unambiguous harmonic uses of equal temperament, we can begin to hear, in the 
music we are making now, a special state of ambiguity, perhaps pleasant or 
disturbing, that is inherent in our modern tuning system and thus quite possibly 
a defining quality of our culture’s music. Our purpose is not to get rid of the 
ambiguity but to understand it. We may be perfectly willing to be confused, but 
we want to be able to label and categorize our confusions.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Consider an analogy with psychology. Historically, the sciences of the psyche 
have been devoted to characterizing the confusions arising between conflicting 
desires. The aim is to understand the terms and vectors of the mind. We know 
today that the mental conflicts of childhood do not simply disappear once we 
have brought them forward into consciousness; rather, we use our understanding 
of them as a lever to balance our lives. Conscious and exposed, conflicts thus 
become less like obstacles and more like operative mechanisms. Likewise, the 
inherent harmonic tensions of our tuning system, which nest in our cultural ear, 
can be brought into the light of conscious hearing, where we can use them to our 
fullest advantage. That is why the dynamics of harmonic ambiguity have become 
our main focus.</p>
        <p class="csht1">IMPROVISING IN EQUAL-TEMPERED LYDIAN</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is time to improvise freely at the equal-tempered keyboard in 
the Lydian mode. Probably the best way to proceed is to begin by improvising 
vocally in just intonation against a drone (singing against your piano drone is 
OK). You might also check out some of the Pythagorean degrees, especially the 
27:16 sixth and the 81:64 third. The next step is to review at the piano the 
equal-tempered Lydian progressions in this chapter. Then, finally, forget about 
the theoretical problems, listen to the sound of your piano, and respond 
musically to what you hear. Play lots of single-note melodies and some chords 
also. Remember to keep the drone sounding in the left hand, but don’t use the 
drone to beat time—that gets old fast. Rearticulate the notes of the drone only 
when you need to hear them. I know that such a limited use of the left hand 
reduces the pianism of what you play, but this is a limited exercise with 
limited objectives; there is still a lot of music to discover inside it. Try 
using your left thumb as a kind of countermelody; or bring the entire left hand 
into a higher octave to help out, providing that the drone business has been 
taken care of. You can sometimes drop the drone an octave for a change of 
texture. Example 23.18 is an example of what is possible.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The Lydian mode belongs to the intervalic family wherein the whole steps 
cluster in twos and threes, as we discussed in chapter 11. We will now guide our 
keyboard music through the rainbow of these modes (exactly as we did in just 
intonation, as singers) observing how our changing position on the lattice 
correlates with the changing qualities of the modes. This time, however, we will 
be tracking the positions of the Didymic pairs of tones on the lattice and 
listening for how these pairs influence the quality of the equal-tempered modes. 
We will show how the primary colors of our lattice rainbow become mixed and 
mottled by the ambiguities of equal temperament.</p>

different tones on the lattice. We are assuming that neither of the drone tones, 
by definition, are heard ambiguously. With this definition, it may be said 
generally that a seven-tone mode can generate a maximum of five Didymic pairs of 
tones. (Ambiguity of the tonic and dominant will show up in part 3 when we leave 
the drone behind.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To sort out the various possibilities, let’s look first at the strongest 
triadic progressions.</p>
        <p class="csht1">TRIADIC HARMONY IN THE MAJOR MODE</p>
        <p class="ctx">The strongest triadic progression in Major, of course, is C to F 
to G to C, the cadential mantra we know and love, discussed at length in chapter 
20. Weaker progressions using the minor triads are both beautiful and extremely 
familiar in popular music, for example, C to Emi to Ami to F to G to C. That 
progression contains no D-minor triad, and as long as D minor is avoided, there 
will be no harmonic ambiguity in the Major mode. But the function of the D-minor 
triad is often ambiguous. There are, after all, two locations for “D minor” on 
the lattice: One is the relative minor of the subdominant, F; the other is the 
minor dominant of the dominant, G. Each has its own affect. Can an 
equal-tempered progression clarify which affect is intended? Yes, I think so. If 
the D-minor chord is in a subdominant context, for example:</p>
        <p class="cop">
          <b class="calibre8">C to Ami to F to Dmi to F to Ami to C</b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx2">then it reflects its reciprocal environment. If the D-minor triad 
is in a dominant context, for example:</p>
        <p class="cop">
          <b class="calibre8">C to Emi to G to Dmi to G to C</b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx2">then it reflects the overtonal environment. In each case, we 
leave home on a harmonic journey and return by retracing our route.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 23.22 combines the above progressions in a shortened version that 
allows you to directly compare the two situations.</p>

function they are not the same.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-506"></a><a href="#calibre_link-429">*17</a></sup> Sung correctly in just intonation, the more 
overtonal, dominant-associated D-minor triad would be twenty-two cents sharper 
than the more reciprocal one. But in equal temperament, meaning is derived from 
context. The question you must eventually address is, Do the two different 
D-minor triads affect you differently? In unambiguous cases like the above, the 
affect, though truly subtle, is nonetheless real and pervasive, a kind of 
refined magnetism, a hidden polarity. As singers in just intonation, we know 
this polarity intimately; it is what moves us, drawing the psyche through the 
regions of its own nature. As pianists, this inner motion is well disguised; it 
is like recognizing a face that has been covered with gauze.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">But what about truly ambiguous cases? What happens when the function of the 
D-minor triad changes <em class="calibre3">at the moment it is sounding?</em> We have come, gentle 
listener, to the nub of the problem.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Possibly the most common progression in the Western world is C to Ami to F to

        <p class="calibre5">In this case, we are led by unambiguous harmonic steps to the subdominant 
function of the D-minor triad, but then, in mid-use, its function flips, 
becoming the dominant of the dominant. We leave our house by the southwestern 
route and return from the northeast. When we approach the D-minor triad we are 
in subdominant yin territory, and when we leave it we are in dominant yang 
territory. We go in subdominant and come out dominant. Does our perception flip? 
At what point? And how on earth could singers ever tune their pitches?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The backward version of this harmony arises in the following way: C to G to 
Dmi to F to C. Such progressions are less common but equally perplexing. The 
general problem can be summarized in this question: How do we respond to 
ambiguous equal-tempered events?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In this case, the “event” is the harmonic function of an entire triad, and 
the specific question is, What is the reality of the second-degree triad in the 
Major mode? Theory teachers call it “the problem of ii” and usually conclude, 
along with their relieved students, that it sounds the way it sounds. The same 
conclusion will eventually be ours as well, of course. But rather than sweep the 
specialness of this problem under the rug, our aim is to extract from it a 
crucial secret about ourselves and the way we hear our music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">But not so fast. By framing the problem this way we have accomplished enough 
for the present. In part 3 the drone disappears and we will meet the source 
deities of equal-tempered ambiguity head-on, quantifying and categorizing as we 
go. We might even be issued clipboards and get to wear white smocks. Meanwhile, 
I will point out not only the Didymic pairs of tones but also the Didymic pairs 
of triads as they occur throughout dronality. We’ll try to discern the amazing 
patterns they create in the lattice, and we’ll search for their musical 
meanings. A good strategy for now is simply to listen to the various dronal 
possibilities as they come out of the instrument, and never stop asking, “What 
is this?”</p>
        <p class="csht1">THE MAJOR MODE WITHOUT TRIADS</p>
        <p class="ctx">Without the clarifying context that triads provide, a simple C 
Major scale played over the drone yields, probably, two Didymic pairs of tones. 
The sixth degree, especially, seems caught between its two selves. It can easily 
be the Pythagorean sixth 27:16 thanks to G and D, but as soon as it associates 
with F or E it will want to be the 5:3 <em class="calibre3">dha.</em> In Western dronal music it is 
almost always sung in its lower form, 5:3. But once when I was teaching a just 
intonation class, one of the students, a beautifully in-tune singer who had 
recently arrived from her native Japan to live in the United States, kept 
singing <em class="calibre3">dha</em> sharp, or so I thought. I would correct her, she would 
bravely sing 5:3 and then wrinkle her nose. The next time she sang the scale, 
there was <em class="calibre3">dha,</em> sharp again. Only after a few passes did I realize that 
she was singing 27:16 most wonderfully in tune—a shining example of the 
Pythagorean major sixth. <em class="calibre3">“Duh,”</em> I said to myself, and assured her that 
her <em class="calibre3">dha</em> was perfect.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The D in C Major also yields, although marginally perhaps, a Didymic pair of 
tones. To evoke the 10:9 <em class="calibre3">re,</em> however, the G of the drone should not be 
sounded, and F should be in the air or close by.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">For these Didymic pairs of tones, as for all of the issues raised in this 
chapter, dipping back into the direct experience of just intonation is the 
most—perhaps the only—clarifying action.</p>

        <p class="csht1">TRIADIC HARMONY IN MIXOLYDIAN</p>
        <p class="ctx">Once more we find that the strongest cadence involves the major 
triads: B<span class="fon">b</span> to F to C. This 
progression of rising fifths, which we could call the Mixolydian cadence, was 
not uncommon in European music around the sixteenth century, but from early 
Baroque times until quite recently it fell from common usage. It is a kind of 
reciprocal version of the cadence of falling fifths—D to G to C—which for three 
hundred years has been a standard Western cadential formula. In the early 1960s 
the Mixolydian cadence began to show up, surprisingly and pleasantly, in British 
and American popular music, and thus has found new life in modern times.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-507"></a><a href="#calibre_link-430">*18</a></sup></p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are many more bland but very smooth progressions using the minor 
triads. Experiment. You may find that ambiguity comes easily in Mixolydian. Play 
C to Gmi to B<span class="fon">b</span> to F to C (over the 
drone), following with your eyes your position on the lattice. How do you 
reconcile where you are with what you hear? As we approach the B<span class="fon">b</span> triad it is the 
relative major of the minor dominant, but as we leave it, it is the subdominant 
of the subdominant. Where does the polarity flip? Now try an opposite version: C 
to F to Dmi to B<span class="fon">b</span> to Gmi to C. (Try 
the root version of the left hand also.) As we approach the B<span class="fon">b</span> triad it is 
subdominant to us, but as we leave it we step directly onto the dominant. Could 
the B<span class="fon">b</span> triad, like a 
homonym, hold two meanings at once?</p>
        <p class="csht1">THE MIXOLYDIAN MODE WITHOUT TRIADS</p>
        <p class="ctx">Without the use of triads, a Mixolydian scale played over a 
drone gives rise to perhaps three Didymic pairs. The sixth degree, A, and the 
second degree, D, behave much like they do in the Major mode, although each 
leans somewhat more convincingly toward its <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded version. 
Additionally we have a new Didymic pair of tones: the minor seventh degree, B<span class="fon">b</span>. The tempered tone 
is only four cents sharper than the purely reciprocal 16:9, and is a full 
eighteen cents below the overtonal/reciprocal mix of 9:5. Nevertheless, because 
of their peculiarly balanced harmonic relation to the tonic, this one seems like 
a toss-up: The equal-tempered tone seems to be suspended between two worlds. 
Notice that the Didymic pair on the minor seventh degree is the exact mirror 
inversion of the Didymic pair on the major second degree. But since reciprocal 
harmony is generally more difficult to hear, the ambiguity seems greater between 
the two minor sevenths than between the two major seconds.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">What kind of minor seventh do singers sing? This is a mysterious subject, 
made even more mysterious by the tempting possibility offered by the seventh 
partial. There are thus three perfectly beautiful resonances occupying the niche 
of the minor seventh, two of them reciprocal and the other <em class="calibre3">blu.</em> What a 
choice! Usually, good singers do make a clean and musically convincing decision. 
But the minor seventh seems to be a particularly watery place in the scale, a 
fine opportunity for expressive ornaments and vibrato. That leaves the ambiguity 
of the tempered note very ambiguous indeed.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">So if you want to know what you are hearing, sing the just resonances in 
appropriate contexts, then review the harmonic possibilities in equal 
temperament while eyeballing the lattice, and then improvise the night into 
oblivion. An amusing (and gorgeous) trick, incidentally, is to use all three of 
the Didymic pairs discussed above in the left-hand voicing shown in example 
23.28 while improvising melodically in the right hand. It seems as if the entire 
available harmonic territory is lit up at once.</p>

Mixolydian. In the North Indian scale most closely associated with Dorian—called <em class="calibre3">
Kafi</em>—the lower, darker 10:9 <em class="calibre3">re</em> is used about as frequently as its 
brighter stepsibling, 9:8. As is also true with both the Major and Mixolydian 
equal-tempered modes, you have to suppress the G and bring forward the F (or F 
together with A) to evoke the 10:9 <em class="calibre3">re.</em> Singing Dorian in just intonation 
will clarify what you hear in equal temperament.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A characteristic feature of Dorian is the tritone between E<span class="fon">b</span> and A. As a singer, you may 
have noticed that is not an obvious leap. Be sure, when you are playing in 
equal-tempered Dorian, to pay that leap its due. Generally it may be said that 
if it takes extra time or effort to sing something well, you should take the 
extra time also when you play it, because even if your fingers don’t need the 
time, your ears do, and your ears should be leading your fingers.</p>

        <p class="csht">Lydian to Phrygian and Back Again in Equal Temperament</p>
        <p class="ctx">This is a good time to review chapter 11, especially examples 
11.1 and 11.2 at the beginning of the chapter, and “Is This a Rainbow?” at the 
end. Against a drone, sing Lydian to Phrygian and back again in just intonation. 
Then, against a drone in equal temperament, play Lydian to Phrygian and back 
again. This presents a splendid comparison between the qualities of the two 
tuning systems. Within the just-intonation rainbow, you can track in a very pure 
way the interactive dynamics of overtonal and reciprocal energies. Within the 
equal-tempered rainbow you can track those same energies, but they are not so 
pure. Mixed in are the ambiguities of equal-tempered dronality: Didymic pairs of 
tones and triads obscure the modes in a fine mist, making them shimmer as they 
progress.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">After you have become familiar with the available triads at the keyboard, 
other combinations will occur naturally: four-tone and five-tone chords in 
various inversions and distributions, chords based on fourths or fifths, 
clusters of tones, or simple <em class="calibre3">collections</em> of tones. While improvising it 
is sometimes permissible to allow the drone to disappear momentarily, but only 
if you are absolutely certain that the tonal center has not changed. In other 
words, the drone must never leave your ear. But it is <em class="calibre3">your</em> ear. Since you 
are the judge of the tonal certainty of your music, the game of dronality is 
played between you the improvisor and you the listener.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Your modal excursions can take one minute or ten minutes or longer. You can 
take your time and investigate the mood of each mode, or you can make a 
convincing allusion and pass on. If you have enough brain left over to remember 
some of the ideas you played as you worked your way from Lydian to Phrygian, you 
can refer to them again when you are going back the other way.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are two paths of wisdom inside this way of learning. The wisdom of one 
path is telling you to keep your mental construct of the lattice intact and to 
track the commas as you play your music. The wisdom of the other is saying: You 
don’t need all this mind to practice dronal improvisation—just do it. The truth 
is, we are now on both paths at once; combined, they make a single path that 
will lead us directly through the territory ahead.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 23.49 is an example of an equal-tempered piece, a kind of written-out 
improvisation, that moves from Lydian to Phrygian and back again. Play it; then 
make one thousand of your own.</p>

        <p class="csht">Gaps in Stacks</p>
        <p class="ctx">The modes we have studied in chapter 23, the so-called church 
modes, account for only six of the many seven-tone modes (about three dozen) 
that hold their own in equal-tempered dronality. None of the others, however, 
can be displayed as a continuous stack of fifths, as the church modes can. This 
is important, because if the central Pythagorean spine is shortened or broken 
(contains gaps), then the ambiguities that arise from the Didymic comma tend to 
disappear, thereby affecting the quality of the mode.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Why should harmonic ambiguity be less when the central spine of fifths is 
shortened or contains gaps? Remember that it is the property of the temperament 
to allow a single tone to stand for two separate tones, each of which occupies a 
discrete position on the lattice of just intonation. In the church modes, where <em class="calibre3">
all</em> the tones can be heard as Pythagorean, any tone that can <em class="calibre3">also</em> be 
heard along an adjacent spine (in other words, as a <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded tone) 
automatically suggests a Didymic pair of tones. In the other seven-tone modes, 
generally speaking, the shorter the Pythagorean spine, or the more the spine’s 
context-generating power is weakened by being discontinuous, the fewer the 
opportunities for the Didymic comma to be a factor in our response. Let’s 
examine this in more detail.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Modes with Four Consecutive Whole Steps</p>
        <p class="ctx">Modes containing four consecutive whole steps were introduced in 
just intonation in chapter 12. Since this chapter parallels that one, a review 
would be timely. Example 24.1 shows the maps of all four equal-tempered modes of 
this type.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When we were singing these modes in just intonation, we confined ourselves to 
a lattice of twelve tones only. Our lattice has now become “extended” and will 
soon include all the tones that equal temperament is able to evoke under any 
dronal circumstance. Notice how the harmonic maps above are exactly like the 
ones in chapter 12, but with various additions to certain spines. The essential 
fact is that equal temperament does not allow the ear to extend the <em class="calibre3">central</em> 
spine in this type of mode.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-510"></a><a href="#calibre_link-434">*21</a></sup> Each of the central spines contains only five 
tones, exactly as in just intonation. Contrast this with the modes of the 
Lydian-to-Phrygian set (in the previous chapter), whose central spines are 
extended in equal temperament to a continuous stack of seven tones. The outcome: 
These modes are harmonically less ambiguous than those. We are more certain of 
where we are.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Also in contrast to the church modes, there now are four (not six) available 
stable triads: two majors and two minors. This smaller pool of available stable 
triads probably means that the weaker, less stable triads—two diminished and one 
augmented—as well as four- and five-tone chords and other collections of tones, 
will play a larger role in the harmony of these modes. Play the triads from each 
scale degree, making sure you stay true to the mode you are in. Then, for some 
amazing and useful surprises, try all the seventh chords and all the ninth 
chords as they arise, degree by degree.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Both a review of chapter 12 and conscious singing practice will remind your 
body of the collection of resonances that characterize each of these four modes 
in just intonation. Then, to put their equal-tempered equivalents in your ear, 
spend some time improvising dronally at the piano in each of them—they are rich 
and may take some getting used to. Find the two diminished triads and the one 
augmented triad in each mode. Notice especially how the augmented triad is a 
result of two stacked major thirds, and that its <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> nature is at the 
heart of the sound of each mode.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now, back to the maps. Look at the central spines of fifths. Notice how the 
modes have been arranged so the central spine notches a fifth lower for each 
mode as you move down the page (as in the Lydian-to-Phrygian set in chapter 23).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now notice how the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spines of fifths and the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below spines 
of fifths all have gaps, or develop gaps. Why is that?<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-511"></a><a href="#calibre_link-435">*22</a></sup> Now compare the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> 
spine of fifths in MIX/LYD with the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spine of fifths in MA/MI: It also 
has moved down a fifth, gap and all. Observe how the progression continues down 
the page, and also how the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below spine of fifths changes from mode to 
mode.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are four Didymic pairs of tones in MIX/LYD, and only two in MIX/PHRYG; 
the other two modes have three pairs each. Each mode has only one Didymic pair 
of triads except for MIX/PHYRG, which contains zero triadic ambiguity. All in 
all there is considerably less ambiguity in this set than in the 
Lydian-to-Phrygian set: That’s what you get with shorter stacks of fifths, and 
hence a lower potential for Pythagorean energy. Here are some specific comments 
about each mode.</p>
        <p class="csht1">MIXOLYDIAN/LYDIAN</p>
        <p class="ctx">I am not at all certain that an authentic pair of Didymic triads 
is formed by the two D-major triads. I suspect the lower one may not be heard in 
equal temperament. In other words, my dronal ear prefers the harmonic path shown 
in figure 24.1, which contains a leap but centers on the tonic, to the path 
shown in figure 24.2, which is direct, but leads you farther from home (even 
unto the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> F<span class="fon">#</span>).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">No Didymic pairs of triads or tones! No commas! Why? Because the central 
spine contains only three tones; the other four are produced in gapped <em class="calibre3">ga</em> 
spines. That gives a very low level of ambiguity, but also only two stable 
triads. Both modes yield fascinating collections of tones as well as 
difficult-to-hear yet beguiling melodies. It does not detract from their 
potential to point out that these modes are rarely used.</p>
        <p class="csht1">IS AMBIGUITY GOOD OR BAD?</p>
        <p class="ctx">The relative rarity of the two modes above gives us a 
clue—namely, that zero ambiguity in equal temperament is not necessarily, by 
itself, a musical advantage. On the contrary, without the added options brought 
about by ambiguity, temperament doesn’t seem to add anything to this mode, it 
merely subtracts resonance. And indeed, we have seen that certain equal-tempered 
modes containing the highest levels of ambiguity, like Dorian and Mixolydian, 
have been found the most useful. Could it be that ambiguity is desirable in 
equal temperament? Do the wider harmonic choices work in our favor? Does the 
fuzziness induced in our template-memory act as compensation for existential 
out-of-tuneness? Or at least act as a buffer against it?</p>

        <p class="csht">Modes Containing Augmented Seconds</p>
        <p class="ctx">Among the modes containing augmented seconds, the first to 
consider is the familiar Harmonic Minor. If we consider also its transpositions 
both up a fifth and down a fifth over a constant drone, we will have a set of 
three modes whose intervalic content is identical. Example 24.8 shows their 
scales and their harmonic maps.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice how, when you read the maps down the page, all the spines notch down 
by a fifth. There are no commas, no gaps in the spines, zero ambiguity. And 
there are four strong triads in each mode.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although they all would sound fuller in just intonation, of course, these 
modes are nevertheless quite tantalizing to play in equal temperament. Pure 
melodic invention over the drone is suggested, but the triadic harmonies are 
particularly compelling. The progression in example 24.9 uses the triads of each 
mode in turn.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are stunning four-tone chords and other collections of tones are 
available for the asking. Example 24.10 also moves through each mode in turn.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Many other modes contain augmented seconds, including some that evoke 
ambiguity of a new kind. A few of these will be discussed in chapter 26. If you 
are curious about the harmonic properties of a mode that is not discussed in 
this chapter, I urge you to draw your own harmonic map. In order to do so you 
will have to make conscious what your ear is actually hearing when you play the 
mode in equal temperament over a drone and then describe that in terms of the 
just-intonation lattice in your brain. It is easy to become confused. The 
subject is confusing. Indeed, the subject is confusion itself. But there are a 
few clear guidelines.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">First, everything is something. Aside from some <em class="calibre3">blu</em>-ish notes in <em class="calibre3">
blu</em>-ish modes, everything authentically heard as dronal in twelve-tone equal 
temperament refers to one or more tones on the five-limit lattice depending on 
musical context. Everything is <em class="calibre3">pa</em> or <em class="calibre3">ga</em> above or below, or some 
combination thereof. At least, that is our primary operating principle.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The secret lies in harmonic continuity, because—just as in coherent 
speech—continuity is what generates context. If tones are generated by an 
unbroken line of fifths, they can be heard as fifths. But if the line of fifths 
is broken, that meaning disappears. A whole step—between B<span class="fon">b</span> and C, for 
instance—is not automatically 9:8 (two fifths distant). In the case of MIX/LYD 
there is no F in the mode to connect B<span class="fon">b</span> by fifths to C, so 
the B<span class="fon">b</span> will likely 
associate with the D as its reciprocal third. The D is the available context 
that gives the B<span class="fon">b</span> meaning; this 
particular B<span class="fon">b</span> has no Pythagorean 
context to resolve its meaning, only a pentamerous one, so it is heard as 10:9 
with the upper tonic. In MA/MI, for another example, there can be no Pythagorean 
B because there is no E in the mode to connect B by fifths to A; therefore, the 
B will most likely associate with the G as its overtonal third and be heard as 
the 15:8 major seventh. But you do have to remember that since equal-tempered 
major thirds are fourteen cents too wide, any context for <em class="calibre3">ga</em> identity has 
to be convincing.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Again, my advice is first to experience the possibilities of the mode by 
singing against a drone in just intonation. Then listen to the equal-tempered 
version with no prejudgment and let your ears tell you what they are hearing. 
Then improvise. Then compose.</p>

      <p class="ctx">WE HAVE INVESTIGATED THE SEVEN-TONE MODES available in 
equal-tempered dronality. Our goal now is to explore equal-tempered dronality in 
its most extensive expression, using its fullest resources. This chapter, which 
parallels somewhat the just-intonation investigations of chapter 15, deals with 
the five most-available chromatic pairs.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">The pianist’s equal-tempered dronal world is different from the singer’s 
dronal world. The singer seeks maximum harmonic resonance by producing tones 
that are site-specific on the lattice. For the pianist there is less resonance 
from pure harmonies, less harmonic truth in the body, and more territorial 
fuzziness due to the approximations of equal temperament. But the pianist has 
ten fingers and can sweep through expanses of territory with swift mobility. As 
one gains harmonic facility, those sweeps widen and quicken until the tonal 
center itself begins to tremble for its life. Our aim is to pull and push and 
test and retest the power of the tonal center. Ultimately we want to learn the 
language of modulating tonal harmony, which is the movement in equal temperament 
through various key centers. To learn that, we need to know how far the 
influence of a single tonal center extends, how it attenuates, and where it 
ends.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Our present plan is to fold the five most-available chromatic pairs 
methodically into our seven-tone modes, noticing, in each case how the harmonic 
palette increases. Since certain chromatic pairs engender more problematic 
contexts than others, let’s begin with the clearest cases.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Major and Minor Sevenths Combined</p>
        <p class="ctx">The most commonly used chromatic pair is formed by a major and a 
minor seventh, which we will examine in the context shown in example 25.1. This 
eight-tone scale contains all of the possibilities of the Major mode and the 
Mixolydian mode combined.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">This part of your work can be enormously rewarding musically. For the fullest 
benefit, first remind yourself of the sound and feeling of this mode when you 
sing it improvisationally against a drone. Make musically intuitive choices as 
to which seventh you use and how you mix them. Then improvise melodically at the 
keyboard over a C-and-G drone, making choices and listening to the results. Then 
start using major and minor triads. This mode’s triad map, shown in figure 25.1, 
combines the maps of Major and Mixolydian. (Notice that figure 25.1 is in staff 
orientation; that is, the triads appear positioned as they would on a lattice in 
staff notation, except that the staff and its noteheads have disappeared.)</p>

        <p class="calibre5">If the drone is intact and care is taken with the voice leading, the ear has 
no difficulty in tracking harmonic leaps like B<span class="fon">b</span> to G, or Gmi to 
Emi, or even Emi all the way to B<span class="fon">b</span>, as shown, for 
instance, in example 25.2. (Also try the roots-in-the-bass version.)</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">There is something new in these leaps. Remember that chromatic pairs are 
melodically close but harmonically distant. When they occur consecutively in 
such triads, the harmonic territory, thanks to the centering effect of the 
drone, seems suddenly and dramatically to expand, and the music takes on a kind 
of complexity we have not met with before. What we have is more than simply two 
modes combined; we have a new mode with a larger compass. This realization will 
eventually allow us to make the conceptual leap from combinations of modes to a 
single all-encompassing mode.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Under certain conditions, both members of a chromatic pair can be sounded 
together with excellent effect. The general rule is this: The two tones should 
be separated from one another by the interval of a diminished octave, as 
demonstrated in example 25.3, as opposed to an augmented octave, as shown in 
example 25.4. Remember it this way: Diminished octaves are “in” (meaning both 
“less than an octave” and “desirable”) and augmented octaves are “out” (meaning 
“more than an octave” and “far out”).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Although diminished octaves involving the seventh degree are quite common (as 
I mentioned in chapter 15), augmented octaves are rare for two reasons: They are 
extremely dissonant, and they easily revert in equal temperament to their much 
more common enharmonic version, the minor ninth. But true augmented octaves can 
be beautiful and musically appropriate. In a certain sense, my own harmonic 
development can be defined in terms of my understanding and increasingly 
frequent use of them. They grow on you. I will point out various uses of 
diminished and augmented octaves as we proceed.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We have examined the triads resulting from two forms of the seventh degree. 
Now, by examining the Pythagorean aspect—that is, the fully extended central 
spine of fifths—we have an opportunity for a new look at the mechanics of equal 
temperament. The extended lattice of our new eight-tone mode is shown in example 
25.5.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">This diagram shows us an inevitable truth (as discussed in chapter 24): When 
the central spine is extended, Didymic commas proliferate. In this case we have 
six Didymic pairs of tones, which means that the eight notes of our mode as 
played on the keyboard stand for a total of fourteen different locations on the 
lattice. Although it is true that certain combinations of possibilities are much 
more likely than others, the entirety of this new harmonic compass is 
nonetheless intriguing. Consider simply the central spine of eight notes. Play 
these on the piano in a sustained upward arpeggio and listen to the augmented 
octave thus produced between the low B<span class="fon">b</span> and the high B<span class="fon">n</span>. Example 25.6 is a 
phrase evoking that augmented octave.</p>

25.2. Can you hear the difference between the pure <em class="calibre3">pa</em> dissonance of the 
Pythagorean pair and the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded dissonance of the major/minor pair? 
This is a fine point, it is true, yet authentic harmonic knowledge rests on fine

        <p class="ctx">Now compare these two versions of the diminished octave. What do 
you hear?</p>

both seventh degrees is that shown in example 25.10.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">We have already named this mode the Utility Minor (chapter 15). Its major and

        <p class="calibre5">There are eight triads in figure 25.4, including one Didymic pair. The triads 
yield progressions such as the one shown in example 25.11. To the stable triads 
may be added the unstable but evocative E<span class="fon">b</span> augmented triad, 
which is actually a stack of two major thirds up from E<span class="fon">b</span>.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The Pythagorean properties of the Utility Minor are less extensive than those 
of the Major-Mixolydian mode described above. Why? Because the eight tones 
cannot be expressed continuously as a stack of fifths; specifically, E and A are 
missing from the central spine, as example 25.12 demonstrates.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The shorter central spine means fewer Didymic pairs of tones (five), less 
harmonic range, and more harmonic certainty. It also means that there are no 
strictly Pythagorean augmented or diminished octaves. Consequently, in this mode 
the major/minor quality of the pair is brought forward; this is especially so in 
jazzy-sounding harmonies such as the one given in example 25.13. (I am omitting 
the drone here, since the harmony is entirely unambiguous without it.)</p>

25.31.</p>

Figure 25.6 shows the major and minor triads.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are five differently named major triads and four differently named 
minor triads in Full Minor and two Didymic pairs. Of the less stable triads, 
there are three diminished and one augmented. There are many flavors of 
diminished and augmented octaves. The full tonal range, with all of the commas, 
is shown in example 25.32.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The object is to make coherent modal music from your nine keyboard tones, 
while at the same time feeling intimacy with the various combinations of major 
and minor degrees. Just as an accomplished painter mixes color by truly seeing 
the paint, you mix these harmonies by truly hearing the sound you play. What 
continues to be amazing is the increase in musical beauty that can arise from 
the increasing palette of harmonic choices.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 25.33 shows a familiar harmonic progression using Full Minor. Notice 
that the bass follows the model of the Melodic Minor scale, that is, the sixth 
and seventh are minor as they descend and major as they ascend. Notice also that 
the passage uses only tonic, dominant, and subdominant triads (albeit with the 
help of the first inversion) and in this respect is a more developed version of 
the mixed-mode cadences of chapter 20 (see examples <a href="#calibre_link-437">20.24</a>–20.31).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Learn to improvise freely using this bass line and these triads in any 
configuration. (Be aware, however, that when the bass voice is the third of a 
triad, that tone should not be emphasized in the soprano.) Example 25.34 is an 
unfinished passage demonstrating some of the available harmony in Full Minor.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In addition to Full Minor, there is a huge variety of modes with two 
chromatic pairs waiting for you to explore them. Some suggestions are given in 
example 25.35.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The idea is not to exhaust the list, but to use it to help internalize some 
of the effects of two chromatic pairs per mode (still over a drone, of course). 
This may be the time in your progress for a greater emphasis on composition. As 
the doorway of equal temperament gets wider, on-the-fly spontaneity and 
slowed-down deliberation need to balance one another. Pick a few modes from the 
list above and write a short piece for each one. Then play them consecutively as 
a suite.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">There are six differently named major, six minor, four diminished, and two

a lot of half-heard nonsense unless you are careful. Don’t lose the source, 
which is the resonance of the pure harmonies of low-prime ratios. Keep checking 
in with your deepest hearing. At this point, ten notes on the keyboard stand for 
eighteen locations on the extended lattice (ten different spellings plus eight 
Didymic pairs), as shown in example 25.37.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">On the page, example 25.39 looks exactly like example 11.2 (p. 69), but there 
is an essential difference. The twelve notes in the earlier example represent 
the five-limit lattice of twelve notes. Now, however, we are working in equal 
temperament, and the twelve notes of our present example represent many more 
than twelve notes and cover a wide harmonic territory that is shot through with 
ambiguity. The entire range is shown in example 25.40.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice that the Pythagorean spine alone extends through twelve notes, and 
that all the notes, with the exception of the tonic (C) and the dominant (G), 
form Didymic pairs. Those ten pairs equal twenty (10 × 2) discrete notes, which 
with C and G add up to <em class="calibre3">twenty-two</em> lattice locations. So there are twelve 
notes within the equal-tempered octave whose pitches potentially stand for 
twenty-two locations on the lattice. The Big Reward of equal temperament comes 
when you can evoke, from these twelve equal-tempered tones, any of those 
twenty-two locations by means of the musical contexts you construct, and your 
music contains the blessings from all of those resonances even if only through 
the veil of temperament.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are sixteen differently named stable triads and only two Didymic pairs 
(two B<span class="fon">b</span> majors and two D 
minors). The entire sweep of this harmonic territory taken at a glance can be 
perceived as a single mode with five chromatic pairs whose center is C. I call 
this full palette of dronal (hence nonmodulating) modality in twelve-tone equal 
temperament the “Magic Mode,”<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-512"></a><a href="#calibre_link-438">*23</a></sup> a conceit for which I beg the forgiveness of the 
reader, who has shown every forbearance up to now. My defense is only that there 
is a quality within equal temperament, some illusion hidden inside its shell 
games and its substitutions, that does seem to have a kind of magic in it. I 
know it’s a trick my own ear plays on me, these approximations so brazenly <em class="calibre3">
standing for</em> real things, but it takes me in anyway, at least sometimes. It 
is also true that when one has been raised in a culture centered on the limits 
set by the Major and Minor modes only, the extraordinary range of modality that 
can radiate from one tonal center using only twelve equal-tempered tones 
definitely has its charms.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">So this is where we are: In twelve-tone equal-tempered dronality, there is 
only one mode, one gigantic ocean of a mode, the Magic Mode. Intimacy with it, 
and freedom within it, is modal mastery. Modal mastery is what precedes mastery 
of modulating tonal harmony. Modulation involves moving the tonal center of a 
mode to a new tonic, a new key. But you can’t artfully move something you don’t 
fathom the nature of. So it is crucial to gain modal mastery at some 
point—sooner rather than later—in your musical development.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">How does one proceed to learn this magic? We have been incrementally leading 
up to it ever since singing our first unison with a drone. The best way to 
proceed now, I think, is through some careful composition. Write a Magic Mode 
piece, not a long one. Better yet, write a series of Magic Mode pieces that are 
between one and two minutes long. Take full advantage of what you have already 
composed. Go slowly. Review the previous material generously. Sing.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Soon enough—in the very next chapter—we will test and extend these limits. 
But let’s pause here long enough to reap benefit from the language we have 
labored to learn.</p>

      <p class="ctx">IN THIS CHAPTER WE WILL BE LIKE SMALL CHILDREN who discover the 
nature of toys by bending and twisting them until they become something else. 
Before we play, however, it would be clarifying to review and put forward 
certain rules and assumptions:</p>
      <ol class="calibre6">
        <li value="1" class="calibre10">The ear perceives frequencies related by low-prime ratios to be harmonious. 
Singing in just intonation centers such harmony in the body, where music lives.</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre10">Tonality is sensible in equal temperament because the approximations of the 
tuning sufficiently (although selectively) awaken our responses to low-prime 
frequency ratios.</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre10">Besides the drone <em class="calibre3">(sa),</em> all of the tones in our tonal system are 
either <em class="calibre3">pa</em> or <em class="calibre3">ga,</em> or compounds of these overtonally or 
reciprocally, up to the limit of the comprehension of the ear.</li>
        <li value="4" class="calibre10">The study of tonality is by definition the study of the harmonic center. We 
need to pin the center down, to focus it sharply, in order to examine it 
thoroughly. In nonmodulating modality the tonal center is assumed to be 
immutable. To insure this, we have been working within the somewhat more 
constrained <em class="calibre3">dronality,</em> where the drone is virtually always in the air. We 
want to avoid any perceived change in the <em class="calibre3">sa,</em> which would constitute a 
change in the center; the same is true, to a slightly lesser extent, for the 
dominant, <em class="calibre3">pa. Sa</em> and <em class="calibre3">pa</em> are thus rendered unique; they occur only 
in the center of our harmonic maps, and the spines above and below the central 
spine are truncated before the appearance of a Didymic sibling of either <em class="calibre3">sa</em>

        <p class="csht">Testing the Rules</p>
        <p class="ctx">Throughout our study, all the items above need to be questioned 
and tested many times. Let’s proceed by questioning the last item: Can there be 
more than twenty-two locations on the lattice to which the ear refers? The 
question leads us to investigate certain highly specific—and very 
fertile—conditions under which harmonies even more remote on the lattice than 
those we have studied can be evoked in equal temperament. But these tricks have 
to be performed in most acutely particular ways or there will be no magic. Isn’t 
it true that the more subtle a thing is, the more refined has to be your energy 
to bring it out?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Specifically, Dr. Overtone claims that there are three tones on the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> 
spine of fifths (see chapter 16) that can be brought forward in equal-tempered 
dronality: C<span class="fon">#</span>, G<span class="fon">#</span>, and D<span class="fon">#</span>. Altering the sequence of our 
original discussion of these tones, let’s consider the C<span class="fon">#</span> first.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">In the case of example 26.3, the tone A has been made so prevalent in the 
tenor that it creates a special context for the black note between C and D: We 
hear it as a C<span class="fon">#</span>. Is this cheating—that 
is, modulating away from our agreed-upon center? Not if you keep your ear in C, 
which the drone does indeed allow you to do. But at the same time, we have 
brought forward the parallel major triad (A major) of A minor: A minor is itself 
the relative minor of C. Once you identify the A-minor sound on the lattice in 
your brain, the C<span class="fon">#</span> appears to make a 
major/minor pair with the tone C, and in that context is harmonically much 
closer to C than is D<span class="fon">b</span>. Example 26.4 is a 
map of the combined aspects of the mode, showing the harmonic derivation of both 
C<span class="fon">#</span> and D<span class="fon">b</span>.</p>
        <p class="img">
          <img src="000421.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The more the tone F is prevalent in the musical context, the greater the 
potential for the ear to identify the black note above C as D<span class="fon">b</span> (a major third 
below F). The more the tone A is prevalent, the greater the potential for the 
appearance of the C<span class="fon">#</span> (a major third above 
A).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The problem is, by evoking the C<span class="fon">#</span> we have produced the augmented tonic, something that a <em class="calibre3">
raga</em> singer would not allow, or even comprehend, as a meaningful concept. <em class="calibre3">
Tivra sa</em>—the sharped tonic—would obviate the immutable nature of the 
generating tone, the source of music and a metaphor for the source of being. 
But, as we have already mentioned in chapter 16 (see <a href="#calibre_link-440">THE 25:24 C<span class="fon">#</span></a>), this particular 
resonance, 25:24, is an especially evocative one, a harmonic constituent of many 
of the most beautiful North Indian compositions. The Indian musician invariably 
calls this tone <em class="calibre3">komal re;</em> its full name is <em class="calibre3">ati ati komal re,</em> which 
means very, very flat (actually, “tender”) <em class="calibre3">re. Ati</em> indeed. It is 
forty-one cents lower than the 16:15 D<span class="fon">b</span>.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Calling that note by the name of C<span class="fon">#</span> under these special circumstances might not greatly 
disturb our Western-trained minds, but something else might. When we use C<span class="fon">#</span> instead of D<span class="fon">b</span>, the scale of the 
mode looks like example 26.5.</p>
        <p class="img">

        <p class="calibre5">We now have <em class="calibre3">a scale of only six degrees,</em> with two forms of the tonic, 
a special sort of six-tone mode. Once we allow tones from the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> spine 
of fifths out of hiding and into our consciousness, they tend to weaken the 
seven-degree paradigm. But you may recall from chapter 14 that although the 
seven-degree scale is an extremely practical concept, it is not a sacrosanct 
one. In chapter 16 we promised to threaten its integrity with a chisel, and now 
we have the chisel in hand.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Let’s compare the alternative interpretations further by melodic means. 
Example 26.6 is a passage emphasizing the C<span class="fon">#</span>.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">First sing the passage in tune over the drone. Then play it in equal 
temperament. Can you still hear C and C<span class="fon">#</span> as a major/minor pair? 
If so, you are playing a (weird) six-tone mode.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Next, to restore the seven-tone model, consider again example 26.2. Sing it 
first, taking care with the 16:15 <em class="calibre3">komal re,</em> and listen for the seven 
degrees to click back into their familiar positions. Then play the passage in 
equal temperament.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The central issue of this book is the behavior of twelve-tone equal-tempered 
tonality. We have addressed it already by tracing the ambiguity caused by 
Didymic pairs of tones and Didymic pairs of triads. Now we are asking if we can 
construct a phrase on the keyboard so that the ear leaps harmonically between C<span class="fon">#</span> and D<span class="fon">b</span>. The answer is yes; 
furthermore, it is a leap that releases a jolt of harmonic energy that is deeply affective, and that we respond to characteristically.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-185" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Great Diesis in Equal-Tempered Dronality</p>
        <p class="ctx">Looking again at example 26.4, observe that the harmonic 
distance from C<span class="fon">#</span> to D<span class="fon">b</span> is three major thirds. On the 
piano keyboard, a stack of three major thirds results in an octave. But each 
major third tuned purely 5:4 is narrower than an equal-tempered third by about 
14 cents; a stack of three such thirds is narrower than an octave by 3 × 13.6 
cents, or about forty-one cents. This means that if you begin with D<span class="fon">b</span> and go up one pure 
third to F, up another to A, and up another to C<span class="fon">#</span>, you will not only have 
climbed up through three harmonic layers, which is a fearsome harmonic distance, 
but also you will be shy of the octave of your original D<span class="fon">b</span> by forty-one cents. 
Forty-one cents is the difference—the <em class="calibre3">comma</em>—between three major thirds 
and one octave. This is the second important comma of our study and is generally 
called the Great Diesis (dee-<em class="calibre3">ay</em>-sis or die-<em class="calibre3">ay-</em>sis). This wonderful 
name, possibly derived from a Greek word meaning separation, was used by 
Alexander Ellis (the translator of Helmholtz) among others. But the same comma 
has also been referred to as the <em class="calibre3">enharmonic diesis,</em> and even the <em class="calibre3">
lesser diesis.</em></p>
        <p class="calibre5">The confusion over names reflects the nonlinear evolution of music theory 
over the centuries. What some acoustic texts call the “Great Diesis” can be 
observed in our text in example 26.40 as the distance between the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> F<span class="fon">#</span> and the Pythagorean F<span class="fon">#</span> (two thirds down and 
eight fifths up, or the distance of two Didymic commas). That interval computes 
to about forty-three cents (hence, “great”) and is almost entirely a theoretical 
interval—that is, it is never evoked and rarely encompassed in actual music. The 
comma we are now introducing—the interval by which an octave exceeds three major 
thirds—is over forty-one cents (hence “lesser”), but because its employment is 
so central to European music, it has come to be known as the Great Diesis, or 
simply, the diesis (by which we will also identify it once it has become more 
familiar). Meanwhile, let’s coin the name megadiesis for the forty-three-cent 
comma and keep Great Diesis for the more functional and greatly appreciated (if 
smaller) comma. The name does have a devotional ring to it, does it not?</p>
        <p class="poem">

        <p class="ptop">We will say a great deal more about the Great Diesis in part 3, qualifying 
and quantifying it until it has become a familiar concept as well as a hands-on 
practical tool for making music. Meanwhile, we can say that the leap of three 
major thirds—in this case between D<span class="fon">b</span> and C<span class="fon">#</span> (in either 
direction)—can occur functionally in equal-tempered dronality and that such 
leaps serve as communication between the far-flung territories of the north and 
south and are part of the palpable magic of the Magic Mode. Try the passage 
shown in example 26.7.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">There is a Great Diesis between the C<span class="fon">#</span> in the A minor/major context and the D<span class="fon">b</span> in the context of the B<span class="fon">b</span>-minor triad. As you 
play the passage repeatedly, your ear leaps back and forth between a location on 
the northern <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> spine of fifths and a location on the southern <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below 
spine of fifths, a triple-<em class="calibre3">ga</em> journey that is harmonically resolved at the 
central point, C. Such is the power of the Great Diesis.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Again let me point out that there is a certain feeling of motion, a <em class="calibre3">leaning</em> toward the A as the tonal center, when C<span class="fon">#</span> is induced. This motion 
is not modulation, exactly, but in part 3, when we break the bonds of dronality, 
that leaning will become an actual stepping away from the tonal center: 
modulation—in this case, a particular type of major-third-driven modulation. 
Meanwhile, we will continue our search for more tones on the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> spine 
of fifths, and hence more invocations of the Great Diesis within dronality.</p>

        <p class="ctx">The modes involving Great Diesis pairs bring us almost, but not 
quite, to the farthest reaches of the lattice. There yet remain two more tones 
on the five-limit lattice of just intonation that can be brought forward in 
equal temperament. One is more Lydian than Lydian, the other is more Phrygian 
than Phrygian.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The Lydian mode is generally characterized by the F<span class="fon">#</span> 45:32. A perfect fifth above this 
tone is the C<span class="fon">#</span> 135:128, a harmony 
ordinarily too remote to evoke in dronality. But if the tonal center is skewed 
toward the dominant side—not a modulation, exactly, but a tilt or tendency 
toward the dominant—then the C<span class="fon">#</span>, which characterizes 
the dominant’s Lydian, becomes sensible. Example 26.33 shows the map of the 
tone’s location and an example of its use.</p>

C<span class="fon">#</span> quite clearly. Notice that the F<span class="fon">#</span> need not be present to 
evoke the C<span class="fon">#</span>. The resulting scale is 
shown in example 26.34. Jazz musicians call this scale the “Lydian Dominant” 
(often regardless of context or function—more will be said about this in part

        <p class="calibre5">At the reciprocal terminus of the Magic Mode lies the tone G<span class="fon">b</span>, which is a perfect fifth 
below the D<span class="fon">b</span> characteristic of 
Phrygian. It usually shows up in what is known as the Locrian mode, which is 
like Phrygian, but with the fifth diminished—that is (in the key of C), with G<span class="fon">b</span> in the place of G. 
The harmonic map for the G<span class="fon">b</span> is given in example 
26.35. It makes, with C, the ratio 64:45.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">In my book—and this is my book—the Locrian mode is suspect in that it exists 
as a latter-day theoretical construct generated to complete the compass of the 
church modes. You may have noticed that you can generate a white-note mode from 
all of the white notes on the piano except B; so, for the sake of tidiness, why 
not designate B as a generating tone also, and call its mode “B Locrian”? My 
skepticism arises from the sense that a mode needs a perfect fifth to sound 
stable; if the fifth is diminished the mode will tilt irrevocably toward the 
subdominant. B Locrian, in other words, is heard as E Phrygian; C Locrian is 
heard as F Phrygian. But, one might ask, what if the drone is so assertive that 
it successfully establishes itself as the tonal center? My answer is that if a 
drone is sufficiently assertive—that is, loud—you can put anything above it, 
including a chain saw, and it will prevail as the tonic of your invented <em class="calibre3">x</em>-mode. 
But don’t listen to me, listen to Locrian. Maybe it truly is on the cusp between 
modality and modulation. See <a href="#calibre_link-297">Extending the Territory: Locrian Lives</a> for an example of a Locrian cadence.</p>
        <p id="calibre_link-449" class="calibre5">Another case of the diminished fifth as a scale degree occurs in blues or 
blues-flavored jazz, where it is mixed in with the perfect fifth, as shown in 
example 26.36.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Notice that the quality of the descending semitone (G<span class="fon">b</span> to F in the second bar) is 
nicely offset by that of the ascending semitone (F<span class="fon">#</span> to G in the first bar). 
But I wonder about any Phrygian analysis. I have heard the blues G<span class="fon">b</span> inflected many 
ways, including a lot of ornamental bending. Blues singers seem to sing it lower 
than the G<span class="fon">b</span> 64:45, and lower, 
even, than the F<span class="fon">#</span> 45:32. Also, Phrygian 
and blues are different things: Phrygian is reciprocal <em class="calibre3">ga</em> music; blues is 
overtonal seventh-partial music. That note could conceivably be the 
seventh-partial of A<span class="fon">b</span>, but it is more 
likely the <em class="calibre3">eleventh</em> partial of C, which makes the very small ratio 33:32 
with F. Another possibility is the <em class="calibre3">ati komal re</em> of F, which is the F<span class="fon">#</span> that makes 25:24 with 
F. Or it could simply be the semitone between F and G. Or all or none of these. 
(Do I hear blues musicians chuckling?) In any case, the blues-style diminished 
fifth sounds most true in the context of subdominant harmony, and whatever it 
is, it can retain its stylistic blues sound in equal temperament.</p>

        <p class="csht">Seventh-Partial Tones</p>
        <p class="ctx">To complete our survey of the Magic Mode we must include the 
special case of the three tones that comprise the <em class="calibre3">blu</em> spine of fifths, 
which appear in chapter 17, and are reproduced in example 26.37 in a slightly 
different form.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The characteristic seventh-partial harmony is immediately recognizable in the 
blues as it is sung and played on variable-pitch instruments. But on the 
equal-tempered keyboard the seventh-partial tones added onto the I, IV, and V 
triads cannot be distinguished from their five-limit stepsiblings unless the 
context is clarified stylistically, which is a culturally learned response, not 
an acoustic one. Acoustic help can be given, however. The seventh partial is 
about thirty-one cents lower than its keyboard equivalent, so in order to give 
the illusion of lowering the pitch, blues piano players typically adjoin the 
semitone below, as shown in example 26.38.</p>

        <p class="csht">Things Not Considered</p>
        <p class="ctx">Before presenting the total content of the Magic Mode as we have 
defined it, perhaps it would be clarifying to mention what we have left out. 
There are no tones from the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga-</em>below spine of fifths—I do not think 
they can be induced without a definite change of tonal center. Also 
conspicuously absent are any Didymic pairings with the drone tones: There is 
only one C and there is only one G. (Well . . . to be honest, the G of the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> 
spine of fifths—wretched <em class="calibre3">pa</em>—was admitted for a brief moment of ascending 
Pythagorean harmony in Dorian, p. 189). Otherwise, however, as mentioned in rule 
4 at the beginning of this chapter, we have been steadfast in refusing entry to 
the C on the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below spine of fifths (which might be called “pathetic <em class="calibre3">
sa</em>”). Drawing the territorial line this way is a simple matter of 
definition. The purpose of the Magic Mode model we have constructed is to 
conceptualize the shape of the five-limit lattice that the <em class="calibre3">nonmodulating</em> 
scale stands for in equal-tempered music. The displacement of the drones by a 
comma does entail a kind of modulation, a leap away from the center. The ear’s 
tremendous desire for the integrity of the center results in a precious benefit: 
an enormous modal territory to make music in, even when that territory is 
subject to the hocus-pocus of equal temperament. It is true that, eventually, 
equal temperament will dissemble the ear’s longing for home and, in atonality, 
be the very instrument of its suppression, but we have a long way to go before 
then. For now, let there be no commas at the center.</p>

merge. Between the Magic Mode and modulation lies bimodal and bitonal 
territory—unstable, moveable ground. Several of the modes given here, especially 
ones involving the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> spine of fifths, can be played at this cusp, and 
it is a good place to play. Between dronality and modulation there is a 
searching kind of energy through which the internal behavior of our aural 
responses reveals itself. When you can freely cross and recross—and even 
straddle—this boundary with your intellect awake, you are experiencing tonal 
harmony in a wonderful way. The boundary territory is self-revelatory, but you 
must know what you are hearing inside the nonmodulating Magic Mode to master its 
wisdom.</p>

        <p class="csht">How to Proceed</p>
        <p class="ctx">The problem with music theory is that it tends to make the 
simple and direct seem complex and remote. Instead of simply playing music over 
a C drone, we now seem to have a pile of off-putting problems. Don’t let that 
be. Play. Music theory won’t get interesting until you have a musical 
sensibility, and music theory won’t give you that sensibility, it can only 
refine it. You have to acquire it by making music. So play—play freely, and then 
compose. Spend many dozens of full hours discovering your version of Magic Mode 
music. Remember, the key of C is only one of twelve.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Here are some ideas to keep in mind about dronality in equal temperament:</p>
        <p class="blockp">Everything sounds OK.<br class="calibre1"/>
Some things sound better than others.<br class="calibre1"/>
A few things sound really good.<br class="calibre1"/>
Something sounds perfect.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It is true that dronality in equal temperament has a kind of grayness about 
it, but that is partly offset by subtle, darting flashes into the far-flung 
territories.</p>

        <p class="csht">Magic Mode Compositions</p>
        <p class="ctx">Example 26.42 is a Magic Mode composition that uses twenty 
tones. What are they? In composing Magic Mode pieces, be sure to proceed slowly 
and carefully enough that you are absolutely certain of where you are on the 
lattice. Then learn to play your piece well enough to project its harmonic 
effect.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 26.43 is a Magic Mode piece in E by the composer Kirk Whipple. Notice 
that in E, Lydian has five sharps and Phrygian has no accidentals. To make a 
thorough analysis, it may help to draw a harmonic map with E at the center. (He 
uses all twenty-eight tones.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Compose your own Magic Mode piece in E. Then try composing a Magic Mode piece 
in F, where Lydian has no accidentals and Phrygian has five flats. Indeed, would 
it not be a fine project to compose a series of twelve Magic Mode pieces, each 
with its own key center? A kind of <em class="calibre3">Magic Clavier?</em></p>

      <p class="ctx">TO OPEN COMPLETELY THE SUBJECT OF modulating tonal harmony in 
equal temperament, we must examine the central issue of commas more closely. 
This chapter is the long-promised chat on commas, including their mathematical 
quantification, as well as a brief general discussion of modulation.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">What Is a Comma?</p>
        <p class="ctx">The word <em class="calibre3">comma</em> comes from the Greek root <em class="calibre3">komma,</em> 
meaning “to cut off,” or “set apart.” In our written language it is, of course, 
a mark indicating a pause or a separation. In the mathematics of musical 
acoustics, large numbers are often generated by multiplying low-prime numbers 
together—usually some combination of 2, 3, 5, and 7—and a comma is the result of 
the very small difference that will sometimes occur between two such large 
numbers. The numbers represent the frequencies of musical tones. Ratios such as 
81:80 stand for the relationship between the frequencies of two tones, and the 
“very small difference” between them will be heard as a minute, yet specific, 
change in pitch, that is, a very small musical interval. This interval is called 
a comma.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We have already introduced the two most musically active commas: the comma of 
Didymus and the Great Diesis. Before going into greater detail about these, 
however, it may be useful to discuss the Pythagorean comma. It is the first 
comma to reveal itself historically, and even though the practical musician will 
not make hands-on use of it, it is nonetheless theoretically and conceptually 
prior to the others.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-578" class="calibre1"><p class="csht" id="calibre_link-196">The Pythagorean Comma</p><p class="ctx">Pythagoras of Samos lived twenty-five hundred years ago. 
According to the philosophers of his time, music was not so much an expressive 
art as a kind of audible mirror of an ideal world. By means of musical 
relationships one could grasp the harmonies of the entire universe, including 
those laws governing the concentric crystal spheres thought to surround the 
world in a vast harmony of the spheres. Much of what we know about Pythagoras 
and his work we know by legend (a fine way of knowing, to be sure), and 
according to legend, he invented the monochord, a musical string stretched over 
a ruler used for measuring the various divisions of the string. Because the 
discovery and quantification of the overtone series is credited to him, we may 
think of him as the Original Dr. Overtone, the Ur-Doctor of Overtones.</p><p class="calibre5">Equating simplicity with goodness, Pythagoras taught that music should 
properly consist only of tones that combine in ratios compounded of the lowest 
primes, namely, two and three. Thus, in the Pythagorean system, all admissable 
musical harmonies have duple or triple nature only, which means—besides 
unisons—octaves (2:1) and twelfths (3:1), along with their octave expansions and 
reductions and their overtonal and reciprocal compounds. In other words, 
Pythagorean harmony is a strict universe of perfect fifths. No pentamerous 
energy, no seventh partials, no anything else. If it is not 3:2 or a compound up 
or down, it does not belong.</p><p class="calibre5">Such a music system is called Pythagorean, and Pythagorean tunings are not 
uncommon today. We have adopted Pythagorean terms in this book: The central 
spine of fifths, for instance, is sometimes called “the Pythagorean spine.”</p><p class="calibre5">One particular result from the process of stacking fifths still amazes 
contemporary musicians as much as it undoubtedly amazed Pythagoras: A stack of 
twelve perfect fifths adds up to only slightly more than seven octaves. The 
small amount by which twelve fifths exceed seven octaves was first described by 
Pythagoras and bears his name: the Pythagorean comma.</p><p class="calibre5">Let’s use the full piano keyboard to visualize the phenomenon. Our object is 
to compare a stack of seven perfect octaves with a stack of twelve perfect 
fifths. The keyboard procedure for comparing seven octaves with twelve fifths 
can be represented on staff notation as shown in example 27.1.</p><p class="img"><img src="000470.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 27.1. Twelve perfect fifths (3:2) compared with 
seven perfect</em></b> <b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">octaves (2:1)</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Imagine for the moment that the frequency of the lowest C on the piano has a 
value of 1. The first octave above it doubles the frequency, so let that value 
be 2. The second octave will then be 4, then 8, 16, 32, and 64. Finally, the 
highest C on the piano, the seventh octave above the starting point, will be 
128, or two times itself seven times, or two to the seventh power (2<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>).</p>
<p class="p">    Next, return to the original lowest C, to which we will again ascribe the 
value 1. This time, however, we will ascend by fifths. Furthermore, we will imagine these fifths to be tuned perfectly in a ratio of 3:2, or, to use the fractional notation, <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>. So the first fifth will be G and its value will be <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>, which can also be written 1.5. The second fifth in the stack will be D, and its value will be <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> × <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>, which is the same as 1.5 × 1.5, or 2.25. For each additional fifth in the stack, multiply (on your calculator) by 1.5, progressing in turn through A, E, B, F<span class="fon">#</span>, C<span class="fon">#</span>, G<span class="fon">#</span>, D<span class="fon">#</span>, A<span class="fon">#</span>, E<span class="fon">#</span> and, finally, to the twelfth fifth, B<span class="fon">#</span>. The value is 129.74632. The value of the frequency of the B<span class="fon">#</span> exceeds the value of the frequency of the highest C by <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">129.74632</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">128</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>.

<p class="calibre5">Example 27.2 is another way of visualizing the Pythagorean comma that is 
perhaps more musically palatable: Build downward from middle C by six fifths, 
and build upward by six fifths also, making a total spread of twelve perfect 
fifths built outward from a central tone.</p>
<p class="img"><img src="000471.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 27.2</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">All of these tones are at least within hailing distance of the Magic Mode of 
C. The reciprocal Pythagorean G<span class="fon">b</span> (we might call it 
distressed <em class="calibre3">komal pa</em>) is distant from the overtonal Pythagorean F<span class="fon">#</span> (exacerbated <em class="calibre3">tivra 
ma</em>) by twelve perfect fifths, which in just intonation will exceed the 
compass of seven octaves by the Pythagorean comma.</p>
<p class="p">    A mathematically more pure way of perceiving this comma—and the way in which 
Pythagoras himself undoubtedly perceived it—does not employ the 3:2 octave 
reduction that allows its musical compass to fit on a modern keyboard. For this 
computation, simply multiply 3 (which stands for the triple nature of the third 
partial) times itself twelve times; then multiply 2 (which represents the duple 
nature of the second partial) times itself nineteen times and compare those 
numbers. The answer is <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">3<sup class="calibre11">12</sup></span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2<sup class="calibre11">19</sup></span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>, or <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">531441</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">524288</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>. This is 
the exact value for the Pythagorean comma. The number says that if you stack 
twelve third partials you will arrive at a tone that is this specific amount 
sharper than a stack of nineteen second partials. The computation of this large 
ratio is possible today in a trice with an inexpensive calculator, but it may 
give you some historical perspective to imagine the staggering intellectual feat 
it must have been twenty-five hundred years ago. Although Pythagoras did seem to 
sense the philosophical significance of his effort, he did not anticipate its 
application to our modern tuning system or its implications for our music.</p><p class="calibre5">Since modern Western musicians are so used to “the circle of fifths” as a 
theoretical concept as well as a practical learning tool, it may be surprising 
to some that twelve perfectly tuned fifths stacked up from C do <em class="calibre3">not</em> equal 
some distant octave of C, and that there is hence no circle of perfect fifths. 
But do consider the reason: A perfect fifth is the harmonic embodiment of triple 
nature, and an octave is the embodiment of duple nature; and these worlds are as 
pristinely distinct as is the prime two from the prime three. Appeal to your 
intuition: How many times would you have to multiply three times itself to 
achieve an even number, that is, a number divisible by two? Think about it. The 
answer is, No power of three is ever even, that is, divisible by two. 
Conversely, how many times would you have to multiply two times itself to get an 
odd number? It can’t happen. Which means that when you stack fifths you will 
never come to any octave of your starting tone. If you enjoy pondering, the 
truly absorbing issue is the deep quirk of providence by which twelve perfect 
fifths contrive to come so close to seven octaves that they nearly but don’t 
quite touch.</p><p class="calibre5">The salient point is that <em class="calibre3">so close</em> is also <em class="calibre3">so far.</em> Think of 
instances in real life where entirely different worlds are separated by the 
smallest boundary. Two strangers sleeping in adjacent motel rooms separated by a 
few inches of wall. Oncoming traffic separated by a yellow line. The inside of 
your body separated from the rest of the world by your skin. Musical commas are 
these narrow but real boundaries that separate, or cut off, one harmonic realm 
from another at a particular point where melodically (i.e., intervalically) they 
almost touch. The melody is close but the harmony is far.</p><p class="calibre5">The interval of the Pythagorean comma is about twenty-four cents. The twelfth 
fifth up, B<span class="fon">#</span>, is twenty-four cents <em class="calibre3">
too wide,</em> that is, sharp, from the octave-generated C. What would happen if <em class="calibre3">
each</em> fifth in our stack were narrowed by exactly one-twelfth of the comma, 
or about two cents? In that case, the twelve narrow fifths would indeed add up 
to exactly seven octaves, and the stack of these newfangled fifths, now called 
equal-tempered fifths, could be drawn in a circle to indicate their cyclic 
nature. When we play these same twelve tones chromatically within an octave we 
generate “the twelve-tone equal-tempered” scale, or the scale of the modern 
piano.</p><p class="calibre5">So each equal-tempered fifth is about two cents flat. How flat is two cents? 
About one-fiftieth of a semitone, which means barely audible. If you train to 
listen for the flatness of an equal-tempered fifth you can hear it. When piano 
tuners tune an equal-tempered circle of fifths they are actually <em class="calibre3">de-tuning:</em> 
They are flattening each pitch by two cents. But they are not using their pitch 
discrimination to do this. They are instead listening for the interference beats 
that indicate a certain amount of out-of-tuneness. In other words, they are not 
so much tuning as <em class="calibre3">counting</em> the desired number of <em class="calibre3">wah-wah-wahs</em> per 
second needed to de-tune that particular fifth. Shocking, perhaps, but true. We 
have a great system of music but our fifths are flat. Welcome to the West.</p><p class="calibre5">The first inkling of the musical utility of twelve-tone equal temperament 
probably took the form of a theoretical speculation by the Chinese prince Chu 
Tsai-yii in 1596. But the concept did not become a useful musical option until 
the eighteenth century in Europe, and then was accepted only gradually and often 
reluctantly. Although the Pythagorean comma lies at the heart of the standard 
modern tuning system, it does not function actively in real-time music like the 
other commas we will study in more detail. The limited musical possibilities of 
the Pythagorean comma are discussed in chapters 33 and 41.</p></div>
      <div id="calibre_link-579" class="calibre1"><p class="csht" id="calibre_link-197">The Didymic Comma</p><p class="ctx">In previous discussion about the Didymic comma (especially in 
chapters 16 and 23) we have talked in terms of stepsiblings, Didymic pairs of 
tones, and Didymic pairs of triads. It is now time to describe the comma in more 
detail and to demystify its math as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Didymus was an academic philosopher of first-century Greece who allowed 
pentamerous energy into the Pythagorean system. The Didymic comma is the amount 
by which a stack of four perfect fifths exceeds the fifth partial. As in the 
case of the Pythagorean comma, we will again use the piano keyboard, but our 
method of computation will be slightly different, the better to visualize the 
ratios involved. First, examine example 27.3.</p>

Skipping over the middle 
bar of the diagram for the moment, notice that the fifth partial produces an E 
whose ratio is 5:1 with the generating tone. We’ll now proceed to raise this E 
by four octaves (you’ll soon see the method in this madness). When you raise 5:1 
by four octaves it becomes successively 10:1, then 20:1, then 40:1, and finally 
80:1. We now have the Pythagorean E (81:1) and the octave-expanded fifth partial 
(80:1) right next to each other in the same octave. Comparing them we see that 
they stand to each other as the number 81 stands to 80, or 81:80. This ratio 
represents the amount by which the Pythagorean E exceeds the pure major third. 
The middle bar of the diagram shows the intervening octaves.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We have already mentioned that the Didymic comma is an interval of about 
twenty-two cents, oddly near to the value of the twenty-four cents of the 
Pythagorean comma, even though it is derived quite differently. Unlike the 
Pythagorean comma, the Didymic comma has an ongoing, real-time, active, 
pitch-sensitive musical function for musicians who sing or play variable-pitch 
instruments, and its effects remain sensible in equal temperament. In other 
words, although the performing musician will virtually never have to deal with 
the difference between twelve fifths and an octave (the Pythagorean comma), the 
difference between four fifths and a pure third comes up in even relatively 
simple harmonic situations. This subject has already been discussed in chapter 
23 and is the primary subject matter of chapters 28 and 29.</p></div>

The two fractions stand to one another as 128 stands to 125, or 128:125. Example 
27.5 shows the notation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The upper C is wider than the B<span class="fon">#</span> by 128:125. The musical interval of this comma, about 
forty-one cents, or almost a quarter tone, is huge compared to the other commas. 
The difference in just intonation is easily audible, and the effect in equal 
temperament is enormous, as we shall soon chronicle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In equal temperament there are “circles of thirds” just as there is a “circle 
of fifths.” We just mentioned that in order to get pure perfect fifths to be 
cyclic, each is shaved by two cents, which is scarcely audible. To get pure 
major thirds to be cyclic, however, each is expanded by almost fourteen cents, 
and fourteen cents sharp is quite audible. The roughness of the equal-tempered 
major third seriously compromises the pentamerous beauty of our culture’s 
musical language. But with the loss of one kind of beauty another emerges: the 
wondrously affective operations of the Great Diesis in modulating tonal harmony, 
a subject discussed in detail in chapters 30 and 31.</p></div>

<p class="csht">The Diaschisma</p>
<p class="ctx">The third functional comma in music is subtle and less common 
but can be most artfully employed. It is the amount by which a stack of three 
octaves exceeds a stack of four perfect fifths and two major thirds. It will 
arise only in certain specialized situations, the most common of which 
symmetrically straddles the tonic, as shown in example 27.6.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For the math, let’s use this practical computational short cut:</p>

This amounts to an interval of about twenty cents. Even though 2025 is an awfully high number to be sensible in just intonation, much less to be traceable in equal temperament, under various conditions it nevertheless does come into play.

      <div id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Modulation</p>
        <p class="ctx">Modulation is a shift from one tonal center to another, a 
“change of key.” Although some of the chord progressions we have used in part 2 
have allowed a considerable expansion of the tonal center, or even a kind of 
circumnavigation of it, until this point we have eschewed actual modulation, 
which requires the clear establishment of a new tonal center. As we study the 
functions of the commas in equal temperament, modulation will become 
increasingly important, so a general discussion of the subject is now in order.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Modulation is the jewel of the West, a territory that Western culture has 
pioneered and plowed. Westerners tend to think in a proprietary way about it, as 
though it had a Western patent, but it is useful to recognize that modulation is 
an extension of modality, not a break from it. It is not a shedding of the old 
but an evolutionary response: Expanded language is developed to express expanded 
experience. As the intellectual and geographical explorers of Europe moved 
outward from their ideas and their towns, the tonal language of their music had 
also to increase its range.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Remember that the simplest pentatonic scale can modulate by simply changing 
its emphasis. Consider once again the basic pentatonic examples 16.10 through 
16.14. We will assume that an unaccompanied singer is moving smoothly back and 
forth between the two modes. As the tonal center alternates between C and A, 
each of the tones acquires alternative functions. When the center moves from C 
to A, for instance, the E that used to be the third is now the fifth; the old 
fifth, G, is the new seventh, and so on, only to revert back to the original 
functions when the music moves back to C. This effect assumes that the two tonal 
centers are closely related harmonically, which means that they are 
geographically close on the lattice and therefore share substantial territory, 
much like two neighboring towns whose fields are held in common.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Perhaps the most beguiling modulatory aspect of all is when two related keys 
split up the ownership of a pair of tones related by a comma. In just 
intonation, the two tones of such a pair will differ considerably in function as 
well as slightly in pitch. In equal temperament, the difference of pitch 
disappears, but the modulatory effect of the comma is still present.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To illustrate, example 27.7 is another look at the territories of “C Major 
pentatonic” (C, D, E, G, and A) and “A Minor pentatonic” (A, C, D, E, and G), as 
discussed in chapter 16.</p>
        <p class="img">
          <img src="000476.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/>
        </p>
        <p class="cap">
          <b class="calibre8">
            <em class="calibre3">Example 27.7</em>
          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The solid line encloses the C Major pentatonic scale. The broken line 
contains the A Minor pentatonic scale. As the center rocks back and forth from C 
to A, four tones (C, E, G, and A) are held in common (i.e., they appear in both 
boxes), and their functions change synchronously with the change in tonal 
gravity. But the case of D is different because there are actually two of them: 
the two D’s of a Didymic pair of tones. They are <em class="calibre3">non</em>common tones: One 
belongs to C Major, the other belongs to A Minor. In just intonation, the 9:8 D 
of C Major is Pythagorean; the 10:9 D of A Minor is <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded. They are 
set apart by the Didymic comma in both pitch and harmonic function: We hear a 
small change in pitch as we hear a large change in function. In equal 
temperament the pitch difference is gone, yet the harmonic effect, washed out as 
it may be, is not washed away.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The many-faceted pleasure of this rocking, back-and-forth motion probably 
dates from ancient times, counted in millennia, and certainly predates triadic 
European modulation. But the ancient modal modulations and the complex 
modulations of modern tonal harmony are based on the same principle: Harmonic 
continuity allows modulation to be sensible. Harmonic continuity means 
geographical proximity on the lattice—clear connection by <em class="calibre3">pa</em> and <em class="calibre3">ga.</em> 
In part 1 we have described the relationships among <em class="calibre3">tones</em> in terms of the 
harmonic continuity between them. In part 2 we have described the journeys of <em class="calibre3">
triads</em> in terms of the harmonic continuity between their roots. Now, in part 
3 (and in part 4 also), we will describe the relationship between <em class="calibre3">keys</em> by 
the harmonic continuity of their tonics. Just as any two tones are heard as 
closely related if they are distant by (for example) a fifth, and just as any 
two triads will be heard as closely related if their roots are distant by a 
fifth, so will any two keys be heard as closely related if the tonics are 
distant by a fifth.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">But to understand fully the mechanics of modulation, it is not enough to look 
only at the tonics; we must consider as well all of the other tones involved. In 
the modulation from C Major to G Major, for instance, the tonics are distant by 
a fifth, and the keys share most of their tones (five or six, depending on the 
tuning) in common. In the modulation from C Lydian to F Phrygian, whose tonics 
are again distant by a fifth, the keys contain only one tone in common (C). Both 
modulations work well because of the fifth between the tonics, but the 
difference in the amount of territory held in common produces a great difference 
in effect. So to understand modulation, which involves the quality of harmonic 
continuity (or discontinuity) between keys, both the relationship between the 
tonics and the mutuality of the territory need to be perceived.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-202" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Where Are We?</p>
        <p class="ctx">We have, as singers, experienced the various resonances of just 
intonation; as both singers and players we have tracked through the common and 
not-so-common modes of the Magic Mode; we have drawn triads the length and 
breadth of the lattice, and done our math homework. Now it is time to stride 
into the forest of commas. We will first examine the effects of the Didymic 
comma in equal temperament, even though these are more muted and subtle than the 
effects of the Great Diesis. Why not examine the Great Diesis first, since it is 
easier to feel and understand and is generally more convincing? A good answer is 
that the Didymic comma, though more difficult to grasp, operates closer to the 
tonal center, is conceptually prior, and arose earlier in history. But the real 
answer is that this is a book, and books tend to be coherent, orderly, linear, 
and rational, everything that music learning is not. So once more let me offer 
this advice: Don’t get stuck. One learns music in dozens of passes over the same 
theoretical ground, and hundreds, even thousands of repetitions of corroborative 
harmonic experience. Get what you can, move on, and come back later. Learning is 
a game, especially learning from books, and one must be sure never to let a 
book, especially a book about music, get the upper hand.</p>

identified the two forms of the major sixth degree (5:3 and 27:16) as a Didymic 
pair of tones we called stepsiblings. We noticed that the stepsiblings share the 
same letter name and solfege syllable and, though near in pitch (only twenty-two 
cents apart), are quite different in their harmonic origins. We tracked their 
disparate harmonic paths. We also made a point of <em class="calibre3">not</em> singing the two 
tones consecutively because, at the time, the large harmonic discrepancy between 
them was more germane to our purpose than the small melodic interval between 
them.</p><p class="calibre5">In chapter 23 we began to put Didymic stepsiblings side by side, first by 
juxtaposing a stack of fifths from C to E with an overtone chord that had an E 
on top. By the end of the chapter we had met a Didymic pair of triads, had 
framed “the problem of ii,” and were able to track other Didymic pairs of triads 
throughout the modal system. It had become clear that in equal-tempered 
dronality, the more familiar modes contain certain triads that are able to serve 
as harmonic pivots, flipping dominant and subdominant energy within the mode.</p><p class="calibre5">In chapter 25 we tracked the various Didymic pairs of tones and pairs of 
triads in the Magic Mode. We described how the harmonic palette expands, through 
their agency, from twelve to twenty-two tones and finally, in chapter 26, 
through the agency of the Great Diesis (as well as some seventh partials) to 
thirty-one tones in the Extended Magic Mode. Our purpose now is to meet the 
Didymic comma “head on” as promised, and to go even farther: to connect the 
quality of the comma in just intonation with its quality in equal temperament.</p><p class="calibre5">Let’s take up the thread of inquiry by going back to the experience we 
specifically avoided in part 1. How does it feel to sing Didymic stepsiblings 
side by side, and what could be the musical value of such an experience? In 
answering this question we will step inside the Didymic comma and walk directly 
through the small number that separates two large numbers. We will enter the 
unknown place that lies between known places.</p></div><div id="calibre_link-581" class="calibre1"><p class="csht" id="calibre_link-205">The Didymic Comma of the Major Sixth Degree</p><p class="csht1">SINGING THROUGH THE COMMA IN JUST INTONATION</p><p class="ctx">We need a Pythagorean spine of four tones—F, C, G, and 
D—comprising three pure perfect fifths, as shown in example 28.1.</p><p class="img"><img src="000477.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.1</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">There needs to be some octave juggling. The best procedure is to tune four 
guitar or harp strings as shown in example 28.2.</p><p class="img"><img src="000478.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.2</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Be painstaking in this work and check your tuning frequently. Alternatively, 
you could use a synthesizer with a Pythagorean tuning program. But if neither of 
these options is possible or practical, an equal-tempered piano will do. This 
may seem surprising, but consider: An equal-tempered fifth is two cents flat, 
which is a scarcely sensible difference. A stack of two tempered fifths is flat 
by 2 + 2 = 4 cents: F to G, for instance, is a major ninth (or major second) 
flat by four cents, which is not terribly noticeable. A stack of three tempered 
fifths results in a Pythagorean major sixth (F to D, octave-reduced) that is six 
cents flat, and the true nature of the harmony is indeed somewhat compromised. A 
stack of four tempered fifths produces a Pythagorean third (F to A) flat by 
eight cents, which is clearly not the “real thing” of 81:64. However, the comma 
we are trying to navigate is twenty-two cents wide; since the equal-tempered 
keyboard slashes off eight cents, that still leaves sixteen cents to listen to, 
and our experiment, though perhaps not as convincing as it would be with a 
perfectly tuned Pythagorean spine, will still demonstrate the phenomenon.</p><p class="calibre5">So, using the best tuning available for the Pythagorean bass, realize example 
28.3 by playing the bass and singing the melody (an octave lower for men).</p><p class="img"><img src="000479.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.3</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">The eight notes needed to sing and play the example above are positioned on 
the lattice as in example 28.4.</p><p class="img"><img src="000480.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.4</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">We will discuss all of the tones bar by bar.</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Bar 1.</em> The E is the pure major third above C.</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Bar 2.</em> The A is the pure major third above F.</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Bar 3.</em> Something strange happens when you strike the bass D. That A 
you were singing in such sweet agreement with the bass F is not the same A 
needed for harmonic agreement with the bass D, that is, its pure perfect fifth. 
You must sharpen your pitch by twenty-two cents (sixteen cents if you are 
playing the bass on an equal-tempered instrument) to stay in tune. This change 
of tuning is the heart of the matter. If you are listening receptively to the 
bass, it is natural to respond to the most active harmonic resonances of each 
tone. The A of bar 2 is the fifth partial of the bass F, and it almost sings 
itself; its sharper stepsibling in bar 3 is the third partial of the bass D and 
arises almost of its own accord. For centuries singers have been adjusting their 
pitches in such passages without giving the theoretical aspects a thought. For 
the singer, the most resonant tunings simply <em class="calibre3">happen</em>, because acoustically 
they are already happening as the bass notes sound.</p><p class="calibre5">Notice exactly what happens to you at the downbeat of bar 3, at the very 
moment the natural resonance of the bass D encourages the pitch to rise. Examine 
your internal energy as you sing your way across the space of the comma. Take 
all the time you need, and do it many times. The focus is on a very small moment 
that has a very large meaning.</p><p class="calibre5">Now, continuing the passage:</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Bar 4.</em> The B is the major third above G.</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Bar 5.</em> The upper C is the octave of the bass.</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Bar 6.</em> As in bar 4, B is the pure major third above G.</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Bar 7.</em> As in bar 3, the A is a pure perfect fifth above the bass D. 
Your voice will find the Pythagorean A, the upper stepsibling that stands 3:2 to 
D and 27:16 to the tonic.</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Bar 8.</em> If you are being sensitive to the harmony implicit in the bass 
string, at the downbeat of bar 8 you will feel the harmonic energy of your note 
change and its pitch will descend. The note that was the perfect fifth of D 
becomes the major third of F. The 27:16 <em class="calibre3">dha</em> gently lowers itself to the 
5:3 <em class="calibre3">dha</em>. Again, let me advise you to take your time in practicing this. 
The way you feel when you navigate this comma is the dot in the center of our 
circle of interest. Is it pleasant? Unsettling? Can you sense how what happens 
between bars 7 and 8 is the reverse of what happens between bars 2 and 3?</p><p class="calibre5">There is obviously another solution to the tuning of this passage, namely, 
that all the A’s be sung 27:16 with C. In that case the thirds above F are 
Pythagorean, 81:64. In fact, E and B could be Pythagorean also. This would wipe 
out the comma, but it would also negate the purpose of the exercise. The idea is 
to sensitize yourself to the most available resonances of just intonation in 
order to discover the anomalies that occur when triple nature and pentamerous 
nature mix. These are the necessities that mothered temperament in the first 
place, and under which twelve-tone equal-tempered tonal harmony arose.</p><p class="calibre5">The short definition of tonal harmony is being someplace on the lattice of 
fifths and thirds in respect to a central tone. The above example generates at 
all times an unambiguous harmonic context, a discrete position in the tonal 
fabric, so that the Didymic comma arises naturally as a consequence of harmonic 
resonance. Sing the entire passage many times, tracking where you are on the 
lattice and appreciating the reversal of harmonic polarity as it occurs. Insist 
on vocal accuracy and maximum harmonic resonance. These resonances open music 
like the sun opens growing things.</p><p class="csht1">MELODIC VERSUS HARMONIC CHARACTERISTICS</p><p class="ctx">From the point of view of mere pitch, moving through the comma 
is simply a slight rise or fall, less than a quarter of a semitone. From the 
singer’s point of view, the vocal chords tighten or loosen by a tiny increment. 
But harmonically, moving through the Didymic comma is a complex event. If there 
is any sensibility at all in the metaphor of harmony as a physical place (as in 
the lattice), then we will perceive ourselves, when singing through the comma, 
as being shifted from one spot to another, perhaps rapidly, perhaps gently, 
perhaps even instantaneously, but physically nonetheless. In this case we are 
shifted by a distance of four fifths and a major third—the Didymic shift, so to 
speak. Some musicians describe this feeling as if they were passive and the 
comma did the work: “we are shifted” or “flown” or “conveyed”; “it is a 
chariot”; “we are in a new landscape”; “a new slide comes onto the screen”; “the 
light and shadow is different”; or “it is a different time of day.” Others 
describe it more actively: “we leap” or “break through.” The singer in this case 
not only leaps across the harmonic terrain but also “contains it” or “takes it 
in” or “ropes it in” or “lassos it” or “captures it” or “entraps it.” There is 
generally a sense of bringing forward, or making real, the harmonic space that 
the comma surrounds. In the process of melodically navigating the comma, we 
evoke, or induce, or activate, the harmonic territory between two fixed 
positions.</p><p class="calibre5">Remember that it is not just the large harmonic leap that comes into play 
here, but the combination of large harmonic leap and small melodic interval. The 
singer takes a leap in one dimension by means of a very small step in another. 
Our fascination with the large result from the small action is related to the 
early philosophers’ keen interest in commas as minute distances that somehow 
arbitrate large, disparate things.</p><p class="calibre5">We do not have to resort to commas to discover musical uses of the contrast 
between a small melodic interval and a harmonic leap. Consider for instance the 
commonly used “leading tone” relationship: B to C in the key of C. The melodic 
interval is a half step, the harmonic ratio (C to B) is 16:15, and the harmonic 
compass is a fifth and a third, shown by the path in figure 28.1.</p><p class="img"><img src="000481.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 28.1</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Next consider a more extreme case, a major/minor chromatic pair (see chapter 15). In the case of E<span class="fon">n</span> and E<span class="fon">b</span>, for instance, the 
melodic distance is again a half step, but a smaller one (the ratio is 25:24), 
and the harmonic territory between the tones is greater—a fifth and two thirds, 
shown by the path in figure 28.2.</p><p class="calibre5">Now compare those cases with the Didymic comma we have been singing: The 
melodic interval is much smaller at 81:80, and there is no functional difference 
of scale degree, since both stepsiblings serve as the major sixth. But the 
harmonic territory between the two tones is now much larger—four fifths and a 
third, shown by the path in figure 28.3.</p><p class="img"><img src="000482.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 28.2</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">So the Didymic comma is a sort of rarefied leading tone, doing maximum 
harmonic work with minimum melodic motion. Let this seeming paradox never lose 
its allure. It is the hidden power of tonal harmony and, as we shall see, one of 
the drivers of equal temperament.</p><p class="img"><img src="000483.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 28.3</em></b></p><p class="csht1">HARMONIC REVERSAL</p><p class="ctx">The essential experience in singing through the comma is the 
sudden sense of reversal in harmonic polarity. In the example above, as the 
resonance of bar 2 changes to the resonance of bar 3, you move in a blink from 
reciprocal, subdominant, yin, moon energy to overtonal, dominant, yang, sun 
energy. The immediacy of the reversal functions like a musical change of 
intention, a discontinuity of mood, a jump splice in the feeling. But we don’t 
avoid it; indeed, we’ve learned to love it, to seek and savor it. If a jazz 
singer were singing the passage, an expressive ornament would typically appear 
between the two A’s: a scoop or a bend or a change in the speed or depth of the 
vibrato, or some other motion to express the emotional change in the harmony. 
Same with a country singer, or one in any ornamented style: The commas drive the 
ornamentation. It is as if the singer has to wriggle the tone because she is 
wriggling inside.</p><p class="calibre5">In light of the emotional charge at the moment of the comma, it is 
illuminating to compare the movement between bars 2 and 3 with the movement 
between bars 7 and 8. As you sing the full passage through, compare your own 
singing impulses and how they affect the quality of your voice at those two 
points. Although we can map the harmonic territory, there is no real map through 
your responses except the one you draw for yourself. Once you are in tune with 
your own responses, the fascination with what others do deepens.</p><p class="calibre5">Remember that the core math is truly simple: 81:80 represents pure triple 
nature close to but not quite touching pure quintuple nature. If your universe 
actually were <em class="calibre3">ruled</em> by the numbers governing these resonances, wouldn’t 
it change rather fundamentally if its pure triple self were suddenly infused 
with Pentamerous Alien Ones? Or, conversely, what if you and your kin were <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded 
from the beginning of time, and suddenly your world became infused with Dry Seed 
Cavity Beings and their bloodlessly pure <em class="calibre3">pa</em> nature? The truth is, when 
you are in tune, your universe <em class="calibre3">is</em> ruled by numbers, or their musical 
equivalent, resonance.</p><p class="csht1">THE DIDYMIC COMMA IN DRONALITY</p><p class="ctx">The musical example we have been singing constructs its harmonic 
context essentially from triads in root position. The ear is given a total of 
eight pitches, most of them connected by continuous harmonic bonds, to get its 
bearings. What about a strictly dronal case where the context is established 
only by a tonic and a Didymic pair of tones? When we sing through the comma, 
does the intervening harmonic territory still become activated? Does the 
polarity flip? Does the chariot appear?</p><p class="calibre5">It is true that the effect of the comma in just intonation, subtle in triadic 
harmony, is even more veiled in dronality, yet in my experience, the answer to 
all the questions above is an unequivocal yes. Time and again my <em class="calibre3">raga</em> 
teacher Pandit Pran Nath lassoed harmonic territory by singing perfectly through 
a comma, vanquishing my heart yet once more. True, his school of singing (Karana 
style) specializes in this type of interplay between melody, harmony, and 
expressive ornamentation, but I believe that if you are motivated to hear these 
things, given your own voice, a couple of drone strings, and some practice time, 
you can discover them for yourself. The more times you return to such practice, 
the clearer the process becomes. You may find it extremely helpful to record 
yourself and listen back—a little modern technology to learn the old ways. It is 
odd, isn’t it, that this ancient way of hearing seems to us planet-hopping 
Westerners the cutting edge of harmonic research?</p><p class="csht1">PLAYING THE COMMA IN EQUAL TEMPERAMENT</p><p class="ctx">When the experience of singing through the Didymic comma of the 
sixth degree in just intonation becomes even a little bit familiar, it is time 
to return to the keyboard. Is the effect of the comma sensible in equal 
temperament? If so, is the effect altered in some way?</p><p class="calibre5">Our musical example will now be fleshed out, with more notes helping to 
clarify the harmonic context. Play example 28.5 at the equal-tempered keyboard.</p><p class="img"><img src="000484.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.5</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Notice that the bass is arranged to give the clearest representation of the 
Pythagorean spine. The full lattice is shown in example 28.6. The two 
stepsiblings of the sixth degree now have the same pitch, of course, and their 
harmonic context ranges from the subdominant to the dominant of the dominant. It 
is entirely clear that there is a harmonic leap, or discontinuity, between the F 
triad and the D triad, and that even though the pitch of the A remains the same, 
what it <em class="calibre3">stands for</em> on the lattice—its just-intonation reference—is 
different for the two triads. The ear fully accepts the function of both triads 
and therefore fully accepts the harmonic leap. The affect of the harmonic leap 
in equal temperament may differ from its affect in just intonation because, 
melodically speaking, in equal temperament the chariot is impeccably at rest; 
that is, the intervalic distance of the comma has been reduced to zero. We are 
thus entirely stationary as the world shifts around us.</p><p class="img"><img src="000485.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.6</em></b></p>
<p class="p">    Whatever forces are at work here, it is important to remember that we are 
dealing not only with the acoustical properties of vibrating things but with our 
own perceptual processes as well. The general question involves how the brain 
mirrors and models reality. But more specifically, questions arise involving, on 
the one hand, how the brain comprehends the inherent structure of the just 
lattice and, on the other hand, the ear’s threshold for deviation under various 
circumstances. How are we allowed instantaneous travel with no change in pitch? 
By what throw of the dice is the equal-tempered major sixth acceptably flat (by 
six cents) of 27:16 and acceptably—though barely—sharp (by sixteen cents) of 
5:3? By what serendipity could <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="sqrt"><sup class="root">12</sup><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="root1">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span><span class="symbol">)</span><sup class="calibre11">9</sup>:1</span> (the ratio of the equal-tempered major sixth) fulfill this 
function? What kind of luck is this, to have a switch of polarity, a guaranteed 
androgyny, hard-wired into our tuning system? Is this the luck of the West?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The crucial experience that vitalizes and illuminates these questions is the 
frequent comparison of singing through the comma in just intonation and playing 
through it in equal temperament. Don’t be too hungry to come to any conclusions, 
or even to form strong opinions about what you are hearing; just listen and 
remember.</p></div>
<div id="calibre_link-206" class="calibre1"><p class="csht">The Didymic Comma of the Second Degree</p><p class="csht1">SINGING THROUGH THE COMMA IN JUST INTONATION</p><p class="ctx">Wherever you stand on the just lattice, if you count four fifths 
up and a third down, or if you count four fifths down and a third up, you will 
find your Didymic stepsibling. All of these various possible sibling pairs 
relate to each other the same way; what is different about them is their 
position in respect to the tonic (which is C for now). As you no doubt have 
noticed from studying harmonic maps, the most frequently occurring Didymic pairs 
have one tone on the central spine of fifths and its same-lettered stepsibling 
on either the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-above or the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below spine of fifths. Such will 
be the case for the fifteen pairs we will eventually study. The following 
examples, then, will begin to show how the various Didymic pairs relate to the 
tonic. Note that where C is located in relation to the arc drawn between the 
siblings is a fair visual image of the tonal effect of the comma.</p><p class="calibre5">Observe in example 28.7 how the stepsiblings of D, the major second degree, 
are more centered around the tonic C than those in example 28.6, the 
stepsiblings of A, the major sixth degree.</p><p class="img"><img src="000486.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.7</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Many useful harmonic pathways arise from the implicit balance of this 
arrangement. Track the following paths with your eyes, remembering that what the 
eye can track on the central lattice, the ear can hear.</p><p class="calibre5">If you start on the lower D (on the left), the path to the higher D can be 
either up four fifths to F<span class="fon">#</span>, then down a third 
(figure 28.4), or inversely, down a third to B<span class="fon">b</span> and up four fifths 
(figure 28.5).</p><p class="img"><img src="000487.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 28.4</em></b></p><p class="img"><img src="000488.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 28.5</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Computing from C, however, the harmonic balance comes into focus. In this 
case, the lower D is either: a third up and two fifths down (figure 28.6) or two 
fifths down and a third up (figure 28.7), while the upper D is two fifths up 
(figure 28.8).</p><p class="img"><img src="000489.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 28.6</em></b></p><p class="img"><img src="000490.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 28.7</em></b></p><p class="img"><img src="000491.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Figure 28.8</em></b></p><p class="ctx">So, from C, the entire harmonic compass of that Didymic pair of

through the Didymic comma to become the third partial of G. As in the previous 
example, you move from reciprocal, subdominant, yin, moon energy to overtonal, 
dominant, yang, sun energy, although in this instance the exquisite balance of 
forces is especially remarkable.</p><p class="img"><img src="000493.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.8</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">Conversely, at bar 6 sing the D as the third partial of G, taking care to

subdominant.</p><p class="calibre5">Practice singing and playing this passage as you would any challenging 
passage of music: Respect it and take command over it at the same time. Remember 
that the focus of the inquiry is the logic and feeling of your own response, so 
sing in tune and stay inside.</p><p class="csht1">PLAYING THE COMMA IN EQUAL TEMPERAMENT</p><p class="ctx">Fleshing out the example above at the equal-tempered keyboard

tied and the harmony leaps. Can you feel the harmony balance around C? What 
happens to you at the moment the harmony leaps and the D changes its meaning? To 
further investigate your response, try improvising melodically in your right 
hand while you play the chords in your left, reacting to the harmony and playing 
the music it tells you to play. Compare your experience in equal temperament 
with your experience in just intonation. Resist finding words for these 
ephemera—there aren’t any anyway, as I am so elegantly proving. Better to simply 
immerse yourself in the music and identify with what you feel.</p><p class="img"><img src="000494.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.9</em></b></p></div><div id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre1"><p class="csht">The Didymic Comma of the Seventh Degree</p><p class="csht1">SINGING THROUGH THE COMMA IN JUST INTONATION</p><p class="ctx">Example 28.10 is the harmonic map of the Didymic pair of B<span class="fon">b</span>’s.</p><p class="img"><img src="000495.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 28.10</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">If you start on the higher B<span class="fon">b</span> (on the right), the path to the lower B<span class="fon">b</span> can be either down four fifths

are experiencing the fact that 9:5, the major third below the dominant of the 
dominant, is not the same as the subdominant of the subdominant 16:9. The 
dominant harmony suddenly becomes subdominant harmony. The entire process is 
reversed between bars 9 and 10: You’ll have to raise the pitch to make an 
in-tune G-minor triad; at that moment, the subdominant harmony becomes dominant 
harmony.</p><p class="csht1">PLAYING THE COMMA IN EQUAL TEMPERAMENT</p><p class="ctx">Instead of singing the top part of the above example, play all

      <p class="ctx">HAVING EXAMINED THE BEHAVIOR of Didymic pairs of tones in equal 
temperament, we are ready to examine Didymic pairs of triads. The change of 
meaning made possible through a single tone is considerably more pronounced by 
means of an entire triad because a triad covers more territory and provides more 
of a harmonic context. Remembering that meaning depends on context, consider a 
tone as if it were an atom. A triad would then be a molecule, and a molecule 
provides a richer context than an atom. Harmonic meaning tends to come into 
focus as triads progress because so much meaning is already inherent in them.</p>

equal-tempered tonality.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Usual Preliminary Advice</p>
        <p class="ctx">The material in this chapter presents a kind of overview of the 
function of the Didymic comma in equal temperament and culminates in a sort of 
aerial map, a table of Didymic triads. It is a map that has never been drawn 
before (as far as I know), and for its mapmaker there is a tremendous excitement 
in seeing it for the first time. But it is also true that there is more 
information here than an intermediate or even advanced musician might care to 
ingest at one sitting. Nor do I need to point out that seven centuries of 
ravishing tonal music has been composed in a variety of temperaments involving 
Didymic phenomena without the benefit of this map. Wonderful as it may be to 
have a new analytical guide, be sure not to let the conceptual models presented 
here be an albatross to your real-time music making. This is a book about music, 
but it is not music. Especially, it is not <em class="calibre3">your</em> music, and you need to 
balance this book and your music according to your best impulses. If that means 
taking a glance and pushing on, glance well. If that means poring over musical 
phrases and prose paragraphs, hang on and let’s go.</p>

        <p class="csht">Staff Orientation and Compass Orientation</p>
        <p class="ctx">The terms <em class="calibre3">staff orientation</em> and <em class="calibre3">compass orientation</em> 
were introduced in chapter 6 (p. 36). Until now, all of our chord lattices have 
been constructed in staff orientation; that is, the triad names appear in the 
same configuration as they do on a lattice of tones. The only difference between 
a chord lattice and a tone lattice is that in a chord lattice the lines of the 
staff, as well as the noteheads themselves, have disappeared. Since we will now 
rely more and more heavily on chord lattices (as well as their extensions, <em class="calibre3">
key lattices</em>), it will become increasingly useful to “unskew” our axes, that 
is, to return them to the strictly perpendicular orientation of a typical <em class="calibre3">x/y</em> 
graph. This enables us to visualize triads whose roots ascend by fifths as 
moving due east, and roots descending by fifths as moving due west, as shown in 
figure 29.1. Triads whose roots ascend by major thirds will now move due north; 
roots descending by major thirds move due south, as shown in figure 29.2.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">In compass orientation, parallel major/minor relationships are no longer 
north-south, but northwest-southeast, as shown in figure 29.3. (This is the 
tricky one.) Relative major/minor relationships are still basically 
northwest-southeast, as shown in figure 29.4.</p>

central lattice in both staff orientation and compass orientation.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The obvious advantage of staff orientation is that the positions of the 
triads relate directly to the positions of the tones on the staff, thereby 
linking the ear’s capacity to compound pure fifths and pure thirds with our 
ability to read music. The advantage of compass orientation is that it refers 
the elemental harmonies (perfect fifths, major thirds) directly to the cardinal 
directions (east-west, north-south). This in turn allows us to “box the 
compass,” a most useful construct in classifying and comparing all of the 
harmonic motions available in equal temperament. We lose the musical staff, but 
we gain a powerful conceptual aid. This will become more clear as we progress, 
but if you are curious to see the results of such analysis, glance ahead to 
chapter 41, especially to its cumulative schematic, figure 41.37, on page 472. 
Further discussion can be found in chapter 43.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Which orientation should be used when? Basically, staff orientation is a 
microscope: Through it you can see the music at the level of its atoms (notes) 
and atomic bonds (fifths and thirds). Chord lattices, however, give the 
perspective of standing back from the music; key lattices even take you on a 
helicopter ride above it. Each perspective has its appropriate analytical use, 
as we shall see.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Didymic Comma of the ii Triad</p>
        <p class="ctx">Let’s resume our discussion of the Didymic comma in equal 
temperament by reviewing some of the material in part 2, deepening and expanding 
as we go. In the key of C Major, consider the arrangement of the triads shown 
(in compass orientation) in figure 29.6. This can be seen as a map of the 
harmonic territory bracketed by the two D-minor triads. A continuous, 
step-by-step visit through this territory can be accomplished with the 
progression in example 29.1, which is essentially the one given in example 
23.22, but this time there is no drone.</p>

          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The first ii chord (bar 2) has a subdominant context; the second one (bar 4) 
has a dominant context. In just intonation, all of the tones in the second 
D-minor triad would be a Didymic comma higher than those in the first one. Play 
the progression rapidly at the equal-tempered keyboard until the two meanings of 
the D-minor chord clarify.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Next, play the common progression shown in example 29.2. It employs the ii 
chord in a pivotal position. (This is given in popular music form in example 
23.23.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It’s useful to know that this passage is unsingable in just intonation 
without pitch adjustments. Specifically, the soprano will have to sing the lower 
D in bar 2 to agree with the alto A, but will then have to raise the pitch at 
bar 3 to agree with the G’s (which of course must agree with the C’s in bar 4). 
Meanwhile, what is the bass to do? If he sings the low D, the interval between 
it and the oncoming G will be a too-small fifth, which would be OK, but he must 
also agree with the soprano—did she move up early to avoid the change of pitch 
at the downbeat? If so, did she take the poor alto with her? Who changes when? 
These are the kinds of questions that sensitive singers must answer intuitively 
in the act of singing in order to stay in tune.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">But the two meanings of the D-minor triad are collapsed in equal temperament. 
The listener simply deals with both functions simultaneously, or at least within 
the same small moment of hearing. At some point we remember where we’ve been 
while recognizing where we are going. Example 29.3 is a slightly clearer case.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The point is, the ear is not automatically jerked to dominant territory at 
the downbeat of bar 3 in the original example; it figures out, after a chord or 
two, where it must be. This assumes, of course, that the ear recognizes the C 
chord at the end as the same C chord at the beginning. “Of course it does,” we 
say, but let’s investigate the alternative.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Let’s pretend that the ear hears the first version of the above example as 
progressing as shown in figure 29.9. In this scenario, we end up a Didymic 
comma, that is, twenty-two cents, flat from where we began, and each time we 
repeat the passage, we’ll be that much flatter. After four repetitions we’ll be 
almost a semitone flat; after nine repetitions we’d be a whole tone flat. That 
can’t be right. What <em class="calibre3">is</em> happening?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We have in fact been operating under the basic premise of tonality: that the 
ear loves the posited tone, the tonic, and holds that tone in the center of its 
harmonic world. If the center does not hold, the meaning and the delight go out 
of its universe. Now, gradually, we are coming to realize that if maintaining 
the center means adjusting reality, then the ear finds its own way of adjusting 
reality.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Pathfinder versus Homebody</p>
        <p class="ctx">The desire for the center may be the basic operative principle 
of tonality, but it is not the only one. There is a logic to harmony, a great 
beauty in the continuity of its motion, and a concomitant drama in its leaping 
discontinuities. These are the mechanisms that allow for meaningful journeys 
through harmonic territory. I like to think of the ear’s ability to track 
harmonic motion along the paths of the lattice as the Pathfinder capacity in us. 
It is our capacity for logic, for map making and map following, our love of 
sweet reason and tidiness of plot, our abiding adherence to the sanity of linear 
order. It has a yang feeling, this part of us, a masculine, no-nonsense, 
this-is-the-way-things-are clarity.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The love of the center is our other side. It is our capacity for integration, 
for holistic thought; it is our sense that the world holds together not through 
reason but through mutual attraction, and that, ultimately, everything fits. 
This Homebody part of us feels yin; it has the feminine quality of encompassing 
unity and the certainty of the hearth.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">These two sides of our nature are not mutually exclusive; they may even be 
versions of one another. But when we listen to tonal music in equal temperament, 
we can feel their separateness. Play through example 29.3 a few more times. Then 
follow along with this scenario.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As we begin bar 1, Homebody is stirring the hearth coals while Pathfinder, 
eager and alert, is sitting on the edge of the easy chair. At the sound of the 
B<span class="fon">b</span> in bar 1, Pathfinder’s ears go forward and his nostrils flare; by the end of 
the bar he has sprung forward and is halfway out the west door; Homebody takes 
down the kettle. By bar 2, Pathfinder is in Full Track Mode, and at the end of 
bar 2 communicates telepathically with Homebody, who is pouring rainwater into 
the kettle, “Position check: relative minor of the subdominant and tracking.” 
Homebody, smiling inside, hangs the kettle from the hearth arm and swings it out 
over the fire. A moment later, at the D chord at the downbeat of bar 3, a 
crackling message comes over the telepath: “Potentially confused. Could be in 
for a long journey—do you read me?”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Homebody puts the tea ball into the teapot and sends the message, “Would you 
like some lemon?”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">At the second beat of bar 3 (the C), there is a quivering kind of flash in 
the hearth room, and Homebody’s chest, already warm, suddenly feels bigger than 
the house. Meanwhile, Pathfinder is being overcome by a pervasive electric 
tingling and a momentary loss of gravity. Over the telepath, amid much crackling 
static, there are two simultaneous voices. “Uncertain conditions . . . 
lightheaded . . . cannot account for direction,” cries Pathfinder, while, as in 
a duet, Homebody’s voice sings out, “Your tea . . . is . . . steeping . . . ” 
Scarcely a moment later, at the G in the bass of bar 4, Homebody receives a 
clear message: “Blue skies, gliding in from the east.” Now Homebody pours the 
tea. At the B of bar 4, Pathfinder’s message is heard as a strong presence just 
outside the east door: “Lemon, please.” At bar 5, Homebody hands Pathfinder a 
steaming cup of fresh tea, pungent with lemon, in a porcelain cup with rosebuds. 
“Your tea is the best tea,” says Pathfinder.</p>
        <p class="ctx1"> </p>
        <p class="ctx1">It might be interesting to play this passage several times, 
first imagining the scenario from Pathfinder’s point of view, then from 
Homebody’s, and finally from the single point of view of you the listener. You 
will probably find that the critical moment in each case is the C of bar 3. That 
is the moment when Pathfinder has the electric experience culminating in the 
recognition that the only return to Homebody is through the east door. At that 
very moment, Homebody’s central feeling extraordinarily expands. Each character 
gets zapped, by which I mean that each has an experience that transcends normal 
capacity. The solution to “the problem of ii” arises from a transcendental 
interaction: Something happens to the two characters that could not have 
happened normally to either alone.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">From the single perspective of the listener, both zaps are one zap, the zap 
of the Didymic comma. In the tiny proscenium of the ear, and within a few 
seconds, the hunger for reason and the love of unity have interrelated 
dramatically, resulting in a transformed capacity for both. The journey through 
darkness and void to light and grace has thus transformed the traveler.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Equal temperament, the potential villain of our tuning history, is, 
heroically, the enabling mechanism here, but the genius of our own response 
should get half the credit. The crucial mechanism by which we respond to equal 
temperament is the built-in adaptability that allows us to accept approximation 
for the “real thing.” Did Pathfinder <em class="calibre3">really</em> come home? We think so. Maybe 
the transcendental zappage of the comma in equal temperament is the brain’s 
confrontation with its own processes. To the extent that this surmise is true, 
it confirms that, for the study of music, the method is the self.</p>

        <p class="csht">Each Comma Works in Both Directions</p>
        <p class="ctx">In the example we have been studying (29.3), Pathfinder leaves 
by the west door and arrives by the east door. Specifically, the ii chord, first 
apprehended as the vi of IV, is subsequently remembered as the v of V. Example 
29.5 reverses that order. The lattice of chords for this passage is shown in 
figure 29.10.</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">In this case, the D triad at bar 2 is clearly the V of V, and the minor-ing 
of the triad simply allows us to hear it as the v of V—the minor dominant of the 
dominant. A moment later, however, the subdominant appears with the tonic in the 
soprano, and the ii chord we have just heard is remembered as the vi of IV—the 
relative minor of the subdominant. We then coast into a perfect cadence, 
tethered by the original C. By heading straight out the east (dominant) door, we 
come to western territory (the subdominant of bar 3).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">This example, as well as the dozens of others coming soon, resembles passages 
from European classical music in that they are all driven by perfect cadences, 
ending with IV (or ii)–V–I, or at least V–I, and hence all of them are biased 
toward the dominant in the final approach to the tonic. But these harmonic 
models do take care to assure that if a triad is intended to have a reciprocal 
identity before arriving at the inevitable penultimate dominant chord, it does 
so as convincingly as possible. In the present case, it does so by means of the 
F chord in bar 3—or, at least, such is the unequivocal tonal memory once the 
tonic is reached.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The pivotal nature of the ii chord is especially clear in this example. To 
clarify this graphically, figure 29.11 shows the lattice of triads with the 
names of only the tonic triad and the Didymic pair of ii chords visible.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">It is extremely useful to alternate between the two ii-chord examples we have 
just examined (examples 29.3 and 29.5). Their juxtaposition brings the reversal 
of the zap, that is, the polarity of the comma, forward. Example 29.6 brings 
them together in a repeated phrase; play it many times, until you are no longer 
thinking chords or functions or fingers, but simply bobbing along in the 
harmonic energy, whatever it is.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Realize that the two D-minor triads we have been discussing represent a 
unique harmonic discontinuity within the tonal gravitational field of C. There 
are at least fourteen other pairs of Didymic triads within C’s sphere, and we 
will soon look at the organization of the entire group. But let’s first examine 
in detail a few more specific cases, eliciting in each case the reversal of 
polarity that so clarifies the effect of the Didymic comma.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">At bar 2 we are at the subdominant, and then the subdominant of the 
subdominant, deep in the heart of western reciprocity. (The faster the tempo, 
the clearer becomes the rhythmic effect resulting from the ties between bars 2 
and 3.) The G-minor triad at the second pulse of bar 3 does not by itself 
indicate a flip to the dominant; but the change to G major in bar 4 is unlikely 
to be heard any other way (although it <em class="calibre3">could</em> progress to A<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> to 
Dmi to Ami to F to C.) At the downbeat of the last bar, one definitely gets 
one’s hot tea with lemon.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Where did Pathfinder’s sense of direction get zapped? Somewhere between the 
end of bar 3 and the downbeat of bar 5. Perhaps the zap was gradual, that is, 
distributed over several beats; this conjecture will come up frequently as we 
proceed. In any case, the B<span class="fon">b</span> triad that at first 
seemed like the IV of IV turned out to function as the III of v, and west became 
southeast.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To better realize the comma, imagine you are singing the tenor part. In bar 2 
you will want to sing a pure third above the Pythagorean B<span class="fon">b</span>; but in bar 3, as 
you sense both the bass and the alto reaching for the Pythagorean G (the 
dominant), you realize your pitch will be too low for the perfect intervals to 
sound between the parts. Thus either you will drag them down by a comma, along 
with the soprano in bar 4 and everybody in bar 5, which would not be nice, or 
else they will force you up through the interval of a comma, which would be 
slightly odd, perhaps, but nicer. In equal temperament, of course, these 
adjustments are internal to the listener.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Since each comma works in both directions, let’s look at the polarity 
reversed, as shown in example 29.8.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The second beat of bar 2 (G minor) is heard as the minor dominant; the 
downbeat of bar 3 (B<span class="fon">b</span> major) as its 
relative major. So the B<span class="fon">b</span> chord is first 
perceived as the III of v. But it follows a strict Pythagorean path back to C, 
so that by the time you get to bar 4, the B<span class="fon">b</span> is remembered as 
the IV of IV. We leave by the east door (dominant) and return from the west, 
even though the passage is finalized by a IV–V–I perfect cadence. (Despite the 
ellipsis of the cadence (IV–V), the continuity in the Pythagorean spine is 
assured by the C tied over from bar 3 to bar 4.)</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Now let’s look at the pair of B<span class="fon">b</span>-major triads. They straddle the tonic as in figure 29.22. 
Figure 29.23 shows the complete rows. The four triads in the upper row we will 
call <em class="calibre3">pa-below</em>-major because their roots are reciprocal fifths of the 
central spine and their mode is major. Let the four triads in the lower row be <em class="calibre3">
ga-below</em>-major; their roots are in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below spine and they are 
major. We’ll call this family the Green Family. Notice that the Green Family’s borders are saw-toothed.</p>

together in their respective families. It will help enormously to understand 
this subject—and ultimately to apply it as a practical musician—if you color in 
by hand the respective colors of the families. While you’re at it, try yellow 
for the two tonic triads, C major and C minor. Then stare at it for a while.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">What we have found is a discrete pattern of triads within the five-limit 
lattice. To turn the picture into music, read on.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-218" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Table of Didymic Triads</p>
        <p class="ctx">What follows is, first, a table of, and later a kind of map 
through, the territory of Didymic harmony. The table and the map show, as much 
as possible, exactly where in the harmonic fabric each of thirty triads that 
surround C turns into its Didymic sibling, and how this can be accomplished in 
four-part equal-tempered keyboard harmony. We’ll discuss the table, shown in 
example 29.16, first.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We have already seen the fifteen pertinent pairs of triads that surround C. 
We have also practiced playing model progressions for four of these pairs. For 
each pair there is a harmonic progression that travels essentially from 
northwest to southeast, and another that reverses the polarity, traveling from 
southeast to northwest. Since each pair needs two harmonic models to demonstrate 
its nature, fifteen pairs require thirty models, which are duly presented here.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">These models are not easy to compose (although I encourage you to try your 
hand at it) because Didymic comma phenomena in equal temperament are by nature 
ambiguous and slippery. Specifically, the zap effect of the comma is often 
spread out over several chords, blurring distinctions and clouding the ear’s 
discrimination. Perhaps that is why this particular map is being drawn more than 
three hundred years after the settlement of the territory. The territory is 
conducive to exploration, but its shape is difficult to imagine. Moreover, we 
are mapping not only a particular thing but our response to that thing as well, 
so to that extent we are mapping ourselves.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Some of the differences from example to example seem tiny. In some, the comma 
is surprisingly difficult to sense; in others it leaps out. From one model to 
the next, chords may be inverted, rhythms displaced, hidden dimensions turned 
inside out. But each model presents the same basic phenomenon—a specific type of 
shift in harmonic position—from a different angle and hence in a different 
light. Ultimately, then, the table of Didymic triads is a multiple exposure of a 
single thing.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I use two diacritical marks. Didymic pairs of triads are separated not only 
by certain distances along the Pythagorean spines but also by a single 
pentamerous move up or down a <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spine. Usually that amounts to a change 
of a triad’s mode from major to minor or vice versa. This change is indicated 
with an <em class="calibre3">m.</em> Also, in each progression I try to pinpoint the pivot chord, 
if there is one, with an arrow. If there is no actual pivot chord, the arrow 
points to the center of the zap, as near as my ear can hear.</p>
        <p class="csht1">THE USES OF THE DIDYMIC TABLE</p>
        <p class="ctx">The organization of the models in the table is not the only 
possible one. Their arrangement, for instance, is not the same as the 
arrangement of the triads in the whole family portrait (figure 29.26), which the 
models are supposed to elucidate. That is because in the table I want the 
fifteen pairs of polarity reversals to be immediately accessible to the player.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Here are various practice suggestions.</p>
        <ol class="calibre6">
          <li value="1" class="calibre10">Whatever you play, track your journey at least once in the whole family 
portrait. Know where you are on the lattice and the direction of the flow.</li>
          <li value="2" class="calibre10">Learn each four-bar passage until it is comfortable to play and you have a 
musical sense of it. Then proceed either down the page or across the page. There 
is no wrong way of doing this, although some juxtapositions seem more 
enlightening than others. As mentioned above, it is especially important to be 
able to hear the polarities immediately reversed, but there are many possible 
procedures.</li>
          <li value="3" class="calibre10">One of the best routines is to play eight-bar phrases repeatedly until they 
are clear to you; then move down the page. That is, start with the G-major pair 
and practice bars 1–8; the next set is the G-minor pair, then D major, then D 
minor, and so on. This preserves the polarity reversal for each triad, as well 
as giving a sense of the comma energy moving gradually east (or west), like an 
intricate weather pattern traveling slowly across the sky.</li>
          <li value="4" class="calibre10">Another way to compare the models is to practice straight across the page, 
sixteen bars to the line, and then work your way down the page—as one would 
normally read music, in fact. This allows you to track the energy of the Didymic 
comma as its Pythagorean bond with the tonic becomes increasingly remote. That <em class="calibre3">
is</em> subtle. Another way to track the same thing, but with mode reversals, is:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="poem">G major, F minor, G minor, F major;<br class="calibre1"/>
D major, B<span class="fon">b</span> 
minor, D minor, B<span class="fon">b</span> major;<br class="calibre1"/>
A major, E<span class="fon">b</span> 
minor, A minor, E<span class="fon">b</span> major;<br class="calibre1"/>
E major, E minor, A<span class="fon">b</span> major.</p>
        <p class="csht1">THE TABLE BECOMES A MAP</p>
        <p class="ctx">Perhaps the most conceptually clarifying practice is to place 
the four-bar models in precisely the same physical configuration as the whole 
family portrait—that is, as their source triads appear on the lattice. This is 
demonstrated in example 29.17. Such an arrangement looks like a highly 
elaborated form of the lattice itself.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The model in example 29.17 no longer displays the reversal of polarity 
between the Didymic pairs; instead, the five-limit lattice organization comes 
into line for both eye and ear. Starting at the upper left, you can play all of 
the <em class="calibre3">ga-</em>major Red Family (G, D, A, E) and hear them transform themselves 
into their southern siblings. Then, all of the <em class="calibre3">ga-</em>minor Orange Family 
(Gmi, Dmi, Ami, Emi) transforming themselves into <em class="calibre3">their</em> southern 
siblings. Then likewise the <em class="calibre3">pa-below-</em>major Green Family (A<span class="fon">b</span>, E<span class="fon">b</span>, B<span class="fon">b</span>, F). Then likewise the <em class="calibre3">
pa-below-</em>minor Blue Family (E<span class="fon">b</span> mi, B<span class="fon">b</span> mi, Fmi).</p>

        <p class="csht">More about Practice</p>
        <p class="ctx">Should you memorize these models? I don’t think so. Should you 
learn to improvise on them? Yes, definitely. Should you compose your own 
versions of the models? Absolutely. (I would be most interested in seeing them.) 
Should you transpose everything to the eleven other tonal centers? Eventually, 
of course.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What will have been gained from all of this? This work with the Didymic comma 
expands musicality in the usual manner of technical practice, by which I mean 
that the point is not to learn models, or even to recognize commas (although you 
can learn to do that as certainly as you can learn to recognize chord 
progressions); the point is to feel more familiar with the territory of tonal 
harmony. When the terrain is sufficiently familiar and friendly it gives 
vitality to your own musical creativity. You don’t ultimately navigate by 
place-names but by ear, by associative memory, by the milestones of 
experience—in short, by feel. These exercises give you the feel of the Didymic 
comma in its many manifestations.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are other ways besides these triadic, cadence-driven models to 
demonstrate the Didymic comma. Some of these will be demonstrated in part 4, 
some you will find yourself, perhaps some have not yet been found. If these 
exercises crease your brain and fry your ear, go on to something else, with my 
blessings and commiserations—we all have our comma quota. Meanwhile, here are 
the Didymic comma phenomena in toto. Work them into your musical life 
gracefully.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The next chapter goes through another entire cycle of commas, but the cycle 
is shorter, is more obvious to the ear and eye, and produces music of great 
harmonic range and heightened expression. When you have had your fill of the 
Didymic comma, at least for now, it is onward to the Great Diesis.</p>

      <p class="ctx">IN PART 1 WE EXAMINED the fifth partial and the pentamerous 
domain. Among other things, we came to realize the difficulty with which the ear 
compounds two major thirds (to make an augmented fifth), and we sang not only 
the enticingly strange <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> G<span class="fon">#</span> but also the wondrously 
bizarre <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> C<span class="fon">#</span>.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">At the end of part 2, while pushing the limits of the Magic Mode (chapter 
26), we first encountered the Great Diesis between that G<span class="fon">#</span> and A<span class="fon">b</span>, although we pointedly did not 
attempt to sing or play through that interval; that is, we did not cause A<span class="fon">b</span> to become G<span class="fon">#</span> while sounding. In this 
chapter we will make that attempt, after first revisiting some oddities of 
pentamerous harmony.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Earlier, in part 2, while composing balanced harmonic progressions, we 
noticed (in chapter 22) that the most structurally solid and acoustically 
sensible root motions are Pythagorean—by fifths up or down—and that movement 
along the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spines (north-south in the lattice) is typically harder to 
sense and definitely more difficult to sustain. To corroborate this, let’s try 
an exercise that will both review and further intensify pentamerous harmonic 
experience: we’ll make harmonically continuous music and deliberately delete all 
fifth motion in the roots.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Figure 30.1 shows a series of triads related alternately by parallel and 
relative harmony. Play these triads, beginning at C. Since there can be no 
leaping whatsoever along the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spine in continuous harmony, work your 
way northward chord by chord to F<span class="fon">#</span>, then come back the 
same way all the way down to G<span class="fon">b</span>, then work your way 
back to C, as shown in example 30.1.</p>

      <p class="ctx">This is not commonly heard harmony—perhaps it is too much of a good thing to 
be musical—but hearing fifthless root motion over such a wide range gives 
insight into the rapid and radical change of scenery implicit in pentamerous 
harmony. To flesh out the music, try to improvise or compose believable music 
based strictly on this harmonic progression. It isn’t easy. Example 30.2 is my 
attempt.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Minor Sixth and the Augmented Fifth Compared</p>
        <p class="ctx">After this taste of pentamerous harmony, we are now prepared to 
traverse the entire compass of harmony that sweeps from the resonance of pure 
major thirds in just intonation to the effect of the Great Diesis in equal 
temperament. We’ll begin the journey by comparing the minor sixth and the 
augmented fifth in just intonation. First, sustain middle C on the piano, sing 
the just major third below, and then, while still singing, add in the lower 
octave of C, as shown in example 30.3. (Review chapter 8 if this is not really 
clear.)</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The next thing is to hear for yourself an equal-tempered context that refers 
convincingly to that experience. The cadences in chapter 20 and the progressions 
in chapter 21 supply many examples; example 30.4 is a model for our present 
purposes. Example 30.5 is a more extended use.</p>

successfully these contexts allow the equal-tempered A<span class="fon">b</span> to stand for the 
8:5 minor sixth.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The next step is to sing the 25:16 G<span class="fon">#</span>. We fleetingly sang this tone at the end of chapter 16 
(pp. 120–121); now we should spend more time with it. The best strategy is to 
tune the guitar’s D string to C, then, using its fifth partial to be sure, tune 
the G string down to the 5:4 E. When you are certain of the purity of the third, 
damp the C, pluck the E, and sing <em class="calibre3">its</em> 5:4 major third, that is, G<span class="fon">#</span>. Then, when you are 
sure of the resonance, add in the C. Finally, damp out the E, as shown in 
example 30.6.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Does this amount to singing in A Minor with its mediant in the bass? To find 
out, try singing in conventional C Major (with a 3:2 G and a 9:8 D). Now, if you 
sing back and forth between the just A-minor triad and the just C-major triad 
over a C drone, you are on the boundary between mode and modulation, a very 
musical place to be.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The next step is to convince yourself of the equal-tempered referent. You 
could simply play example 30.9 on the keyboard. Example 30.10 is a more 
convincing cadential construction.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The work is to make whatever connection you can between the feeling of the 
25:16 G<span class="fon">#</span> and the equal-tempered 
G<span class="fon">#</span>. What strikes me about 
this harmony is how far out the 25:16 G<span class="fon">#</span> is, but how familiar 
and tame the equal-tempered modulation to vi has become through constant use. It 
is an aural leap to make that black note between G and A into a 25:16 G<span class="fon">#</span>—a forgiveness of 
twenty-eight cents, to be exact, but by now it fits like an old shoe. When 
temperament was new, that shoe was new. One learns to hear with ancient ears.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The next step in our A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> 
comparison is to compare the harmonic effects each produces. We have already 
done this in equal-tempered dronality (refer back to example 26.17); now we are 
using more modulatory material. First, play example 30.5, then example 30.11, 
alternating between them many times. The passage containing A<span class="fon">b</span> we associate with 
the reciprocal thirds of C Minor, the <em class="calibre3">parallel</em> minor of C Major; the 
passage containing G<span class="fon">#</span> we associate with the 
overtonal thirds of A Minor, the <em class="calibre3">relative</em> Minor of C Major. As seen from 
the vantage point of C Major, then, these two passages represent an alternation 
between parallel and relative territory. We first were introduced to this 
concept in chapter 20 but did not dwell on the contrast in feeling between the 
two realms. Now, with our harmonic language expanding, we can more clearly hear 
how evocative is the complimentarity in mood between the reciprocal thirds of 
the parallel Minor and the overtonal thirds of the relative Minor.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">One way you can practice appreciating this is to learn each of the two 
previous chordal examples well enough to improvise on them. Example 30.12 is a 
written-out improvisation on each.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Everyone touched by Western culture is familiar with the complimentarity, in 
the Pythagorean dimension, between dominant and subdominant harmonies. At the 
outset of our training, both as listeners and as musicians, we learn to 
recognize and form the cadential energies of I, IV, and V triads. What is also 
part of the culture, but in a less pronounced way, is the pentamerous version of 
the cadential dance, the parallel/relative flux that balances the ear at the 
tonal center in the pentamerous dimension. The point of your work now is to 
juxtapose parallel and relative harmony in such a way as to develop an intuitive 
affinity with reciprocity in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> dimension just as you already have in 
the <em class="calibre3">pa</em> dimension. (This crucial step is omitted in conventional theory 
and its pedagogy.) Sensitivity to the directionality of energy flow in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> 
dimension will open your sensitivity to the effect of the Great Diesis, which is 
a kind of short-circuit in that flow.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Try to improvise freely using the following key scheme: C Major to A Minor to 
C Major to C Minor (repeat this many times). Be sure to use the tone G<span class="fon">#</span> in A Minor and the tone 
A<span class="fon">b</span> in C Minor. Try to 
bring each realm into being with an economy of means, as suggested in example 
30.13.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Although the idea is to manipulate the musical context so as to convince 
yourself that the black note between G and A is either the A<span class="fon">b</span> of C Minor or the G<span class="fon">#</span> of A minor, try not to 
meld the two meanings. We will soon enough do that deliberately, and in quite 
specific ways. For now, try to rock convincingly between the two functions until 
you can hear the music in your head without touching the keyboard.</p>
        <p class="csht1">SINGING THROUGH THE A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> DIESIS IN JUST INTONATION</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is time, finally, to sing through the Great Diesis in just 
intonation. To accomplish this you need to tune two guitar strings to C and E, 
as you did for example 30.6, then tune the B string up to C (or tune the high E 
down to C). As always, be perfect in tuning.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We’ll proceed at first by singing only from A<span class="fon">b</span> to G<span class="fon">#</span>, not the other way. Pluck the C; 
find the in-tune A<span class="fon">b</span> with your voice; 
then, being certain to damp out the C, immediately pluck the E, letting your 
voice relax down into the G<span class="fon">#</span>, as shown in example 
30.16.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">And relax it will: forty-one cents worth of relaxation. This comma is 
definitely perceptible as a change in pitch—by almost a quarter tone. (The ratio 
of the A<span class="fon">b</span> to the G<span class="fon">#</span> is 128:125; see chapter 26.) Notice that as the pitch lowers, the harmonic energy rushes from the 
reciprocal <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below region to the extremely overtonal <em class="calibre3">ga-ga,</em> a 
northward harmonic surge of three major thirds. So as the pitch goes down, the 
harmony goes up, unlike the pitch and harmony of the Didymic comma, which have a 
more subtle relation. (Check that out in both staff orientation and compass 
orientation.)</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Practice singing through the comma several times, double-checking the tuning 
of your strings as you go. Try to identify, and identify <em class="calibre3">with,</em> the 
responses evoked by navigation through the Great Diesis.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In the previous chapter, we spoke of the “zap” of the Didymic comma. That zap 
is intensified in the case of the Great Diesis for three reasons: The pitch 
difference is greater (almost double); the harmonic distance is greater (the two 
extra <em class="calibre3">ga</em>’s more than make up for the four fewer <em class="calibre3">pa</em>’s); and the 
direction of the pitch moves entirely contrary to the direction of the harmony. 
One author (Easley Blackwood) quotes a Greek source meaning of <em class="calibre3">diesis</em> as 
“a discharge,” and it does seem to be true that a buzz of energy is unleashed in 
the brain at the moment of the diesis.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The zap of the Great Diesis is unique and pronounced; but what is its 
quality? Perhaps it is more than merely musing to observe that Pathfinder, the 
protagonist we met during our Didymic adventures, seems not so stressed or 
confused in the diesis context. The experience is more like an elaborate, 
instantaneous acrobatic flip than a disintegration and reintegration, possibly 
because the harmonic path, though far, is direct: a straight shot in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> 
dimension. Discovering your deep response to the Great Diesis is surely one of 
the ten thousand greatest things you can do, and definitely at the heart of this 
study. Yes, you have to learn it over time. It is also true that once you become 
aware of it you never forget it.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 30.17 demonstrates a very practical way that the Great Diesis, in a 
somewhat compromised version, can be evoked at the equal-tempered keyboard with 
the help of your voice. The temperament shaves off about a third of the comma 
(about fourteen cents), but you will still be able to feel your way by seeking 
the pure tunings for the thirds you sing.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">In North Indian <em class="calibre3">raga,</em> singing through the Great Diesis is a sublime 
though unusual expressive device. But in most other music meant to be sung with 
pure harmony, the sounding of the Great Diesis is even more rare. Why so 
uncommon? Because such music—late Medieval European music, for 
instance—ordinarily does not gobble up in a single moment an amount of territory 
large enough to require singing through the Great Diesis. It takes a large 
palette of harmonic possibility to structure and define a tonal swath wide 
enough to require an A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> dovetail, and a large palette of 
available triadic harmony is precisely what temperaments produced. The musical 
use of the Great Diesis arose more or less synchronously with the rise of 
temperaments, especially twelve-tone equal temperament, wherein it becomes an 
extremely useful harmonic pivot, as we shall see. Our aim is to follow the 
thread of experience that shows how the sensibility of such harmony in equal 
temperament is grounded upon its reference to the resonances of pure pentamerous 
harmonies.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Bar 1 is in C Major but “borrows” the A<span class="fon">b</span> from the parallel Minor. Bar 2 
begins unambiguously on an F-minor triad, and at the third beat the music could 
easily return to C; the G of the soprano, for instance, is heard as the major 
seventh above A<span class="fon">b</span>; likewise, the D is heard as Pythagorean. But all of the tones of bar 2 could have another meaning as well, and by beat 4 that possibility is foremost, thanks to the E-major triad, which immediately is identified as the V of A Minor. The soprano G, as it turns out, was a diminished octave above the bass G<span class="fon">#</span>, the interval created by a chromatic major/minor pair of sevenths: G<span class="fon">#</span>/G<span class="fon">n</span> in A Minor; likewise, the 
Pythagorean D becomes its darker Didymic sibling, the subdominant of A. The 
A-Minor triad of bar 3 is perceived only momentarily as a tonic chord; it 
quickly functions as part of a vi–IV–V cadence in C Major. The note on which the 
diesis occurs here is the G<span class="fon">#</span> in the bass in bar 2; 
it supports the upper voices as the harmony flees northward. What happens in 
your ear during the last half of that bar?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 30.19 places the diesis tone in the soprano and offers a more 
definite modulation to A Minor.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Notice how the diesis tone is central to the expression. In bar 
3 the ear wants to dally on the semitone that the alto’s entrance makes with the 
soprano, at least for a moment; but when the E strikes at bar 4 it is as if we 
cannot linger long enough to absorb the new feeling. The soprano’s upward leap 
of a diminished seventh keeps us lingering even longer, but as it resolves the 
harmony clarifies, the tempo resumes, the big moment is history, and everyone 
goes back to the beginning to do it again.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As always, examine your response at the moment of the diesis. Remember, at 
some level the ear is forgiving forty-one cents. What exactly replaces that

        <p class="calibre5">Example 30.20 is a clear and efficient version that does nothing to suffuse, 
or even soften the edges of, the effect of the comma. To tell ourselves what 
happens, we can use the language that we developed in the study of the Didymic 
comma and say that we leave home (C) by the southern door (the parallel realm) 
and arrive from the northwest (the relative realm). We can say we were zapped 
over a distance of three thirds in the overtonal direction. We can examine the 
lattice of tones note for note, tracking our position at every moment. Indeed, 
all of the descriptive and metaphorical language we have developed for one comma 
we can use for the others. What is different from comma to comma is the 
character, the quality, of the musical experience, and each musician has to 
sense, remember, and categorize for himself or herself the qualities of the 
commas. Your music will soak up these qualities in a unique and personal way. It 
is all a private matter, and the deeper your hearing the more private it 
becomes. The miraculous aspect is that once your music is made, the private room 
nobody could enter except yourself turns out to be the very room that everyone 
longs to share in common, and does. The common room of this deep harmonic 
experience is the reason that music is our first and best hope for a universal 
language.</p>

        <p class="ctx">We’ll now go back to singing this comma, but in the other 
direction. The big difference is this: By any measure, A<span class="fon">b</span> is within the tonal 
field of C; G<span class="fon">#</span> is only marginally so. 
Moving from A<span class="fon">b</span> to G<span class="fon">#</span>, as we have just done, 
moves you from C to the edge of its tonal boundary. Beginning with G<span class="fon">#</span> and moving to A<span class="fon">b</span> takes you from the 
fringe and moves you closer to the center. Also, the pitch of the diesis tone 
rises as the harmony falls.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We will use our same two guitar strings, having meticulously checked their 
tuning. Play and sing as shown in example 30.21.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Play C first, to establish the tonic in your ear, then play E and damp C. Now 
sing the pure third above E and hang on until you are sure of the resonance. 
Still hanging on, play C while damping E, and try to find C’s reciprocal pure 
third. You’ll glide upward, but that’s OK—practice to make the forty-one-cent 
hop (it will feel like a small leap) as clean as possible. That will 
conceptually clarify the comma, even though the experience may not feel terribly 
musical. Singers and players, when forced by harmonic circumstances to negotiate 
the comma, glide rather than hop through it. Indeed, it can be downright 
disconcerting to take the comma all at once, much more so in just intonation 
than in equal temperament, where only the context changes, not the pitch. Try 
hopping, then gliding, and compare the two.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 30.22 is the keyboard-assisted version, which is fourteen cents

        <p class="calibre5">The diesis tone is exposed in the alto over the bar line. The augmented triad 
on the last eighth note of bar 1 is slightly ambiguous, softening slightly the 
effect of the diesis, but at the downbeat of bar 2 the harmony has almost 
certainly reversed, and the entrance of the E<span class="fon">b</span> in bar 2 clinches 
it.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It is, in fact, most usual to buffer the moment of the diesis with ambiguous 
material such as the augmented triad at the end of bar 1. This ambiguity, which 
arises from the temperament itself, distributes the function of the comma over a 
longer period, thereby attenuating its effect. We can think of this ambiguous 
material as the equal-tempered version of a singer in just intonation who 
glides, rather than hops, through the comma.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 30.24 is an extremely direct and unambiguous version, more of a leap

        <p class="calibre5">The harmony moves unambiguously from E<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> at the end of bar 1 to F 
minor at the downbeat of bar 2. In this direction of harmonic flow—from the G<span class="fon">#</span> of the relative Minor 
to the A<span class="fon">b</span> of the parallel 
Minor—the diesis harmony seems particularly compelling, and in conventional 
music it is the preferred direction. I can think of two reasons for this. First, 
it is the same type of direct falling harmony (from overtonal to reciprocal) 
that produces, in the <em class="calibre3">pa</em> dimension, the yang decisiveness of the perfect 
cadence. Falling fifths are certainly the engine of European tonal harmony; the 
harmony we are studying now involves instantaneously falling thirds, so it can 
be considered as the pentamerous, comma-induced version of the West’s main move. 
Second, the voice leading is particularly serendipitous. Three tones from the <em class="calibre3">
ga</em> spine that appear in A Minor, namely A, E, and B, appear a semitone lower 
in C Minor as A<span class="fon">b</span>, E<span class="fon">b</span>, and B<span class="fon">b</span>, providing many opportunities 
for a sighing trio of down-ward-leading major/minor chromatic pairs to enhance 
the descending harmony. In fact, the only rising aspect of this harmony is the 
forty-one-cent rise in the pitch of the diesis, which is, of course, absorbed by 
the temperament.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Besides ambiguous material, another means of smoothing the effect of the 
comma is through dissonance. Consider the jazz version in example 30.25.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The stacked-third dissonances characteristic of jazz replace the purity of 
triads and establish modal contexts instantaneously. The downbeat of bar 2, for 
instance, contains five tones from A Utility Minor (including the diminished 
octave from G<span class="fon">#</span> to G<span class="fon">n</span>); the second beat contains five 
tones from C Utility Minor (rendering the old diminished octave G<span class="fon">#</span> to G<span class="fon">n</span> into a major seventh A<span class="fon">b</span> to G, and adding a <em class="calibre3">

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 30.32 shows one more loop: the special case of diminished seventh 
chords. The diminished seventh chord of bar 1 is ambiguous: Without additional 
context we would expect it to be Bdim<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>, containing an A<span class="fon">b</span>, since A<span class="fon">b</span> is closer to a 
C-major triad than G<span class="fon">#</span>. But when we hear the 
A-minor triad, the ear recognizes the continuity of the G<span class="fon">#</span> and remembers the chord 
as the vii/vi, or G<span class="fon">#</span> dim<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>. In bar 
2 the G<span class="fon">#</span> is at first believed, 
since we have now tilted toward A Minor. But as soon as we hear the C triad, the 
ear recognizes the continuity of the A<span class="fon">b</span> and remembers the 
chord as the vii/I, or Bdim<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>, with the A<span class="fon">b</span> borrowed from 
Minor. Since the two diminished seventh chords contain identical pitches in 
equal temperament, the ear is confronted with ambiguity in a repeated, condensed 
form.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Unlike major or minor triads, which strongly suggest context, an isolated 
diminished seventh chord presents so many potential harmonic contexts that it 
signifies virtually none. The ear therefore tends to hear it for what it is: a 
division of the octave into four equal parts, a quadrisection of an octave. Such 
equal divisions give rise to symmetrical harmony, of which there is an abundance 
in equal temperament. The ear recognizes symmetrical harmony as a middle ground 
between tonality and atonality. Every diminished seventh chord contains the 
potential for various commas, and they are a favorite diesis-generating device. 
They can generate commas in cycles that spin away from the tonal center, 
flirting with symmetry and eventually atonality. These circumstances will be 
discussed much more fully in part 4.</p>
        <p class="ctx1"> </p>
        <p class="ctx1">All of the musical passages quoted above exemplify, in their 
various ways, a triple <em class="calibre3">ga</em> leap between the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> spine of fifths 
and the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below spine of fifths, with the Great Diesis, induced by 
proper context, providing instant transport. What I have advised you <em class="calibre3">against</em> 
doing in just intonation I strongly recommend in equal temperament: reiterated 
practice of the Great Diesis, bringing it forward until it is your friend. The 
secret is, I think, to enter willingly into the moment of the unknown and to be 
filled with it. There is no question that we unconsciously seek similar little 
swoons in art and in daily life. We “go out” on experience whenever we can, 
smelling a rose, taking in the stars, enjoying the first sip after a long 
abstinence—little everyday commas that purposefully overwhelm the mind. I am 
asking you to do this consciously in the highly structured circumstances of 
diesis practice. Enter the smoky moment of the comma with your lights on. There 
is a fierce wisdom in the way music creates new harmony by confounding the logic 
of the old.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="ctx">NOW THAT WE’VE EXAMINED the Great Diesis between A<span class="fon">b</span> and G<span class="fon">#</span> from the vantage point 
of the tonic C, a new question emerges: How many Great Dieses are functional 
within a given tonal center, and how are they organized? Remember (how could you 
forget?) that in chapter 29 we found fifteen pairs of Didymic triads and drew a 
map depicting their relationships. But the situation with the Great Diesis is 
not quite analogous. For one thing, although a pair of diesis <em class="calibre3">tones</em> can 
exist—marginally—within a tonal center, the harmonic disparity between a pair of 
diesis <em class="calibre3">triads</em>, A<span class="fon">b</span> major and G<span class="fon">#</span> major, for instance, is 
too great to be contained by one tonal center. There is, however, an orderly 
array of diesis pairs of <em class="calibre3">tones</em> within a single tonal center. Each pair 
behaves more or less like the A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> pair we have studied, yet each 
generates a harmonic color all its own. We’ll now consider them one by one.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Overtonal Diesis Family</p>
        <p class="ctx">There are three major thirds within the compass of the A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> diesis; <em class="calibre3">two</em> lie above C and <em class="calibre3">
one</em> lies below. Since such an arrangement favors the overtonal direction, 
let A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> be called an <em class="calibre3">overtonal diesis</em> 
in C. Consider, then, the similarly configured dieses shown in example 31.1.</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">All of these dieses might be considered as emanating from the <em class="calibre3">ga-</em>below 
spine of fifths: D<span class="fon">b</span>–A<span class="fon">b</span>–E<span class="fon">b</span>–B<span class="fon">b</span>. I’ve drawn arrows from each 
tone in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below spine of fifths to its diesis mate in the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em>-above 
spine of fifths, indicating that the pentamerous harmonic energy flows away from 
the center in the overtonal direction. (It might help to color the arrows, from 
left to right, blue, yellow, orange, and red.) The only difference among these 
diesis pairs is their placement in the Pythagorean dimension; the work all of 
them do in the pentamerous dimension is identical. We will call these four 
pairs, then, the overtonal diesis family.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Does the harmonic energy flow back the other way—is there a reversal of 
polarity within overtonal family pairs? In the case of the A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> pair, we have seen that it does. 
But in equal temperament A<span class="fon">b</span> is much more 
securely a part of the tonality of C than is G<span class="fon">#</span>; a harmonic context 
inducing G<span class="fon">#</span> requires either a 
modulation to A Minor or a nascent sense of one. As we go along, we will 
likewise not only consider the reversal of harmonic polarity within each pair 
but also describe its modulatory behavior.</p>

evocative in dronal just intonation, partly because of the dissonance they 
create with the drone, and partly because of their innate harmonic qualities. 
What we have not done is sing through the Great Diesis that separates them. 
Alas, our usual method, using the guitar, is a bit cumbersome: We need, besides 
the C string, a pure 4:3 F and a pure 8:5 A. Try tuning the high E string to F <em class="calibre3">
(</em>carefully, so as not to break it). Then tune the B string to A. 
(Alternatively, the entire experiment could be lowered a semitone.) When you are 
certain of your tunings, try the sequence of events shown in example 31.2.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The first two bars establish the Phrygian Major mode. At bar 3 the music 
could still be in Phrygian Major, despite my spelling of C<span class="fon">#</span>; but by the resolution 
of bar 4, the force of the comma has been “discharged” and we are in D Minor. So 
the ambiguities of the diminished harmonies in bar 3 distribute the effect of 
the comma over the bar. At the end of the third beat of bar 6 there is a 
momentary V<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> chord, reminding us of I (although inducing a Didymic 
pair of D-minor triads to do so). In bars 7 and 8 D Minor is reestablished. At 
the downbeat of bar 9 there is the momentary ambiguity of the D<span class="fon">b</span> augmented chord, 
but by the E<span class="fon">b</span> of the third beat 
we are in B<span class="fon">b</span> Minor, which 
cadences, in Phrygian style, back to C. So the force of the comma is distributed

the previous chord turns out to have been the C<span class="fon">#</span>dim<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>

then we immediately leave it (by the downbeat of bar 4), using the D Minor 
material that has just sounded. The second beat of bar 4 could be in D Minor but 
turns out to have been the V<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> (in second inversion) of C Phrygian.</p>

the D<span class="fon">b</span>–C<span class="fon">#</span> direction. Also, it is 
more clearly modulatory than preceding ones. To help understand this example, 
notice that the dissonant collection of tones shown in example 31.9 is common to 
both D Utility Minor and F Aeolian (or C Phrygian).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The change in spelling represents the diesis. Notice in example 31.8 how a 
simple difference in passing tones (the E<span class="fon">n</span> of bar 4 has become 
E<span class="fon">b</span> in bar 5; in bar 6, 
A<span class="fon">n</span> becomes A<span class="fon">b</span>) changes the 
context from D Minor (with a C<span class="fon">#</span>) to F Minor (with a D<span class="fon">b</span>). The process is 
reversed in the second half of the passage: The E<span class="fon">b</span> and A<span class="fon">b</span> of bars 11 and 12 
become E<span class="fon">n</span> and A<span class="fon">n</span> in bars 13 and 14, 
effectively changing the context from F Minor to D Minor.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice also that although these keys are tonicized, they are still clearly 
heard as iv and ii from the vantage point of C. The C<span class="fon">#</span>/D<span class="fon">b</span> diesis is thus heard as 
bracketing, or encompassing, the territory between the two. The entire 
construction lies, in fact, a fifth below the A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> diesis and is a subdominant 
version of it. In both cases the energy shifts between material associated with 
the parallel Minor (C Minor, F Minor) and the relative Minor (A Minor, D Minor). 
We will continue to look at this particular parallel/relative way of straddling 
the tonal center; it is the distinguishing characteristic of the overtonal 
diesis family. In working with the D<span class="fon">b</span>/C<span class="fon">#</span> examples and comparing these with 
the A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> examples, try to discern the 
musical differences between them. Go past the notes into the harmonic quality,

        <p class="calibre5">Since this diesis proceeds from E<span class="fon">b</span>, it is part of the C Minor mode (as opposed to C Major). 
This allows the direct comparison of two Minor keys separated by the distance of 
a major third: C Minor and E Minor. These were hinted at in the A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> diesis (F Minor and A Minor) and 
in the D<span class="fon">b</span>/C<span class="fon">#</span> diesis (B<span class="fon">b</span> Minor and D Minor), but in 
this case one of the keys is the tonic itself, so we can enjoy the ride with no 
intermediary.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Beginning with C, the common tones between the two modes (indicated by 
unbroken vertical lines) are C, D, G, A, and B. E<span class="fon">b</span> and D<span class="fon">#</span> are diesis mates 
(indicated by a dotted line). The half step D–E<span class="fon">b</span> is a diatonic 
semitone in C Minor; in E Minor the half step D<span class="fon">n</span>–D<span class="fon">#</span> is a chromatic pair. (Visually, 
looking at the keyboard, it seems as if, when the F of C Minor goes away, the E 
and F<span class="fon">#</span> of E Minor appear to 
replace it. Can you trace what actually happens, degree by degree?) In this 
arrangement of modes (two Minor keys separated by a major third) lies a rich 
vein of music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">All of the above examples move from C Minor to E Minor and back again, 
demonstrating the oscillation between parallel minor and relative minor 
territory. None <em class="calibre3">begins</em> with E Minor, since D<span class="fon">#</span> (unlike either G<span class="fon">#</span> or C<span class="fon">#</span>) is scarcely available to us in 
the equal-tempered domain of C. There is no way the ear will hear the music of 
these examples as simple events in C; it is neither dronal nor modal—we have 
left those worlds for now. This music clearly moves us away from C; it 
modulates. It is an example of what is conventionally termed “modulating tonal 
harmony,” or sometimes simply “tonal harmony.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 31.15 is a passage that begins in C Major, tonicizes E Minor (by 
means of its ii<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>–V<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>), then, at the moment of diesis, 
borrows from C Minor—a complex and beautiful harmonic path, as opposed to simply 
a “chromatic” one.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">This is fairly remote harmony, since the C mode (MIX/LYD) is none too stable, 
and the B mode is relatively distant from C. Still, I hear it as a modulatory 
event leading out from and back to C, and the diesis mates do straddle the 9:8 
D, as example 31.1 has indicated. I cannot convince myself, however, that the 
F/E<span class="fon">#</span> diesis, which would be 
the next fifth higher on the lattice, is part of C, so my list stops here. Nor, 
incidentally, can I convince myself that the G<span class="fon">b</span>/F<span class="fon">#</span> diesis, which would be the next 
fifth lower than the most subdominant harmony in the overtonal diesis family (D<span class="fon">b</span>/C<span class="fon">#</span>), is part of the tonality of C. 
The tonal function seems to drop off steeply at both the east and west ends of 
the series, like continental slopes, leaving us high and dry with four 
functional diesis pairs in the overtonal diesis family. Reexamine example 31.1, 
and at the keyboard compare the models exemplifying the various pairs. In each

        <p class="csht">Pentamerous Harmony</p>
        <p class="ctx1">The term <em class="calibre3">pentamerous harmony</em> refers to harmony that 
employs the 5:4 major third in its primary function. In conventional analysis 
the term <em class="calibre3">tertiary harmony</em> refers simply to harmony that moves by thirds. 
But some thirds are major, some are minor, some are <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded and some 
are Pythagorean. In the progression of major triads C–F–D–G–C, for instance, the 
motion from F to D is an overtonal leap of three perfect fifths, which produces 
a Pythagorean minor third, whose quality is Pythagorean, not pentamerous. So we 
need a new name to help us make this crucial distinction between the harmony of 
perfect fifths and the harmony of pure major thirds. Failure to do this accounts 
for the confusions and disappointments of conventional theory.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Specifically, pentamerous harmony moves north and south along four spines of 
thirds, namely, the <em class="calibre3">pa</em>-below spine of thirds, the central spine of 
thirds, the <em class="calibre3">pa</em> spine of thirds, and the grand-<em class="calibre3">pa</em> spine of thirds. 
(See the discussion preceding example 16.20 for a review of lattice 
nomenclature.) Pentamerous harmony has its own special character, which 
contrasts with Pythagorean harmony in the most musically useful ways. A primary 
purpose of this study is to bring forward that contrast and render it practical 
for every musician.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 31.23, then, is the lattice of Great Dieses, a combination of the 
overtonal and the reciprocal diesis families, a compilation of the eight dieses 
we have studied originating from the tonal field surrounding C. (Again, it is 
best to color the arrows a pair each of blue, yellow, orange, and red.)</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">For a Great Diesis to function within the domain of C, two conditions have to 
be met: (1) One tone of the diesis pair must originate clearly in C, and (2) the 
two tones in the diesis pair must straddle one of the four central Pythagorean 
tones (F, C, G, or D). Those conditions yield the eight pairs depicted above in 
example 31.23. Notice also that the twelve central notes of this lattice—the 
three central spines of fifths—are the same as “the central area of the harmonic 
map” shown in example 9.37. This area is “central” because it comprises the 
tones with the lowest ratios in respect to C.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Moving the diesis one fifth further to the right or one fifth further to the 
left takes us beyond the corona of C: The pull of tonal gravity will no longer 
be centered. Moving the diesis a third further up or a third further down 
requires too great a modulation from C and the tonal thread will be broken. <em class="calibre3">
Nevertheless,</em> if a reader with a keen ear and a pentamerous flair can 
compose an example of a diesis that functions within the framework of C beyond 
those discussed here, I will send, by return mail, a personalized drone ring 
(include initials and ring size please) or its equivalent. Meanwhile, it is at 
least pragmatic to say that, to be tonally stable, one tone of the diesis pair 
must be in the twelve-note lattice of the tonal center, and the territory of the 
diesis must straddle the central spine.</p>

        <p class="csht1">AUGMENTED CHORDS</p>

Each triad may be considered a stack of two major thirds, for instance, A<span class="fon">b</span>–C and C–E. Looking at the lattice, we see that we could stack one more third on top of this chord, producing A<span class="fon">b</span>–C–E–G<span class="fon">#</span>, which results in the A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> diesis (see example 31.24a); or we may add one more third to the bottom of the original chord, producing F<span class="fon">b</span>–A<span class="fon">b</span>–C–E, which results in the E/F<span class="fon">b</span> diesis (see example 31.24b below).</p>

the center of the harmonic territory, and then tipped either overtonally or 
reciprocally according to the needs of the music. (The typical resolutions are 
given in example 31.31.)</p>
        <p class="csht1" id="calibre_link-470">DIMINISHED SEVENTH CHORDS</p>
        <p class="ctx">Because neither augmented triads nor diminished triads enclose 
harmonic territory as do major and minor triads, (which we picture on the 
lattice as triangles), they cannot be considered as proper triads, although they 
can be musically oriented to function momentarily as such. They are, rather, 
much looser collections of tones whose harmonic territories are open-ended and 
spread out over a larger area, and they thus play an important role in the 
dynamic ambiguities of equal temperament. As we have seen above, an augmented 
triad looks like a straight line—part of a <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spine—on the lattice. A 
typical diminished triad looks like example 31.25.</p>

in example 31.30. Although the two chords are definitely not identical (there 
are indeed substantial differences in their use), their primary functions of 
resolution (to C in this case) so serendipitously overlap that they are 
considered pals, if not twins. Example 31.31 affords the opportunity to compare 
the elements of these related harmonies in respect to their positions on the 
lattice. The dominant seventh chords are shown in diesis-driven resolutions.</p>

central tone of a <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spine; that is, each tone is straddled by two major 
thirds above and two major thirds below. Directly above this construction are to 
be found the chords typically generated by these tones, listed (reading down the

        <p class="ctx">A further illustration of the modal dynamics between the 
overtonal diesis and the reciprocal diesis might help clarify the most 
mysterious—and perhaps most compelling—aspect of pentamerous harmony. To 
accomplish this, we will select and compare two dieses available from C: an 
overtonal diesis as seen from C Major and a reciprocal diesis as seen from C 
Minor.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">First, imagine we are standing in C Major invoking the overtonal diesis A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span>. To involve A<span class="fon">b</span>, we borrow it from the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below 
spine of fifths, which lives in the territory of our<em class="calibre3"> parallel</em> Minor, C 
Minor. The A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> diesis then flips us to our <em class="calibre3">
relative</em> Minor, A Minor. We have borrowed the G<span class="fon">#</span> from the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> 
spine of fifths, which lives in the territory of A Major (which is in turn the 
parallel Major of A Minor). The salient point: <em class="calibre3">We have gone from C Major 
mixed with Minor to A Minor mixed with Major.</em> From the vantage point of C 
Major, it looks like figure 31.3. Even though the keys of C Major and A Minor 
are the central keys in the A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span> diesis, the Diesis pair itself is 
taken from spines adjacent to those central keys: the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spines below 
(for A<span class="fon">b</span>) and above (for G<span class="fon">#</span>).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Now follow me patiently through the reciprocal language of the above 
situation. Imagine that we are standing in C Minor and invoking the reciprocal 
diesis B/C<span class="fon">b</span>. To involve B, we 
borrow it from the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> spine of fifths, which lives in the territory of 
our <em class="calibre3">parallel</em> Major, C Major. The B/C<span class="fon">b</span> diesis flips us to 
our <em class="calibre3">relative</em> Major, E<span class="fon">b</span> Major. We have 
borrowed the C<span class="fon">b</span> from the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em>-below 
spine of fifths, which lives in the territory of E<span class="fon">b</span> Minor (which in 
turn is the parallel Minor of E<span class="fon">b</span> Major.) The salient 
point: <em class="calibre3">We have gone from C Minor mixed with Major to E<span class="fon">b</span> Major mixed with

though the keys of C Minor and E<span class="fon">b</span> Major are the 
central keys in the B/C<span class="fon">b</span> diesis, the diesis 
pair itself is taken from spines adjacent to those central keys: the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>

present and entirely sensible in actual music as it is sounding. I hope this

        <p class="csht">The Uses of the Lattice</p>
        <p class="ctx">The goal is to learn to recognize the various effects of the 
Great Diesis and weave them with facility and confidence through your own music. 
My suggestion is to experiment with the diesis tones one pair at a time, 
beginning with A<span class="fon">b</span>/G<span class="fon">#</span>, until you have a repertoire of 
combinations involving that pair. Then try the same with D<span class="fon">b</span>/C<span class="fon">#</span>; next, from the reciprocal family, 
B/C<span class="fon">b</span>, all from the 
vantage point of C, of course. Then E<span class="fon">b</span>/D<span class="fon">#</span>; then experiment with the others. 
Whether you practice hearing reverses of polarity or moving the diesis pairs by 
fifths, any direction you turn on the lattice will be a useful one.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">But too much concentration on any of the commas can make you woozy—this one 
especially. Practicing the Great Diesis is like working in an incense factory. I 
recommend intense concentration over mercifully brief periods of time. Revisit 
and hone your compositions. Learn the other eleven keys. (Remember, it takes a 
decade to learn a key, so if you are assiduous you will live long.) Never lose 
touch with the pentamerous source. Keep a special niche in your altar for the 
pure major third.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Taken as a group, the Great Dieses of equal temperament have provided a 
mechanism for the beauty of Classical and Romantic concert music to arise out of 
the very temperament many feared would be the death of harmony. It is true that, 
given the rough approximations and maddening inflexibility of equal temperament, 
something did die. We lost the deep resonances, and in the process became sadly 
distanced from some primal part of ourselves. But in that same process, an 
astonishingly affective musical language was born.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Pentamerous harmony has been not only the glory of equal temperament but 
also, more recently, its undoing. The role that the equal-tempered major third 
has played historically in the development, transformation, and eventual 
unraveling of tonal harmony will be discussed later, especially (in part 4) in 
respect to cyclic and symmetrical harmony.</p>

      <p class="ctx">THE THIRD (AND LAST) OF THE COMMAS functional in twelve-tone 
equal temperament is the diaschisma, the amount by which three octaves exceeds 
four perfect fifths and two major thirds (see chapter 27). Our study of the 
diaschisma will differ somewhat from our study of the Didymic comma and the 
Great Diesis primarily because the harmonic territory that the diaschismic pairs 
of tones encompass is so vast. The immediate result of the harmonic shift 
occurring over so wide an area is that the affective zap is attenuated: The 
longer the distance the weaker the signal. Furthermore, the tonal ambiguity is heightened; contexts in which the diaschisma occurs can easily jeopardize the 
stability of the tonal center or even set it spinning. Although these events are 
difficult to produce and rarely heard in just intonation, equal temperament is 
well suited to convey their harmonic meanings, and nineteenth-century European 
harmony thrives on them.</p>

        <p class="csht">Singing through the D<span class="fon">b</span>/C<span class="fon">#</span> Diaschisma in Just Intonation</p>
        <p class="ctx">So large is the harmonic compass of the diaschisma, in fact, 
that with narrow exceptions, pairs of diaschismic tones do not exist within the 
same tonal center, at least not in dronality. But there is a single case where 
singing through the comma in dronal just intonation is very useful. Sing and 
play at the keyboard example 32.1.</p>

is, it needs to be the <em class="calibre3">tivra ma,</em> or augmented fourth, of the G Lydian 
mode. The other tones in the melody will help to evoke the Lydian quality. When 
you come to the downbeat of bar 3, transform the note you are singing into the D<span class="fon">b</span> a pure major third 
below F, which is to say, the <em class="calibre3">komal re,</em> or minor second, of the C 
Phrygian mode. If the played pitches were tuned in just intonation, your voice 
would rise about twenty cents in singing through the comma from C<span class="fon">#</span> to D<span class="fon">b</span>. But if you use the 
equal-tempered keyboard, the tuning adds about four cents to the comma, actually 
making it a little more sensible for the singer; it’s nice, for a change, to get 
an equal-tempered break in our favor. In any case, if we call the C<span class="fon">#</span> “super-Lydian” (a fifth 
higher than the Lydian F<span class="fon">#</span>), then we might say 
that the comma spans a <em class="calibre3">Super-Lydian/Phrygian</em> compass, as demonstrated in

typically a <em class="calibre3">modulatory</em> device; it is used expressly to catapult the ear 
away from the tonal center. Historically, from the late eighteenth century on, 
as the affective possibilities of equal temperament were discovered by European 
composers and unveiled in their music, this modulatory usage became more and 
more frequent. To understand it fully we must briefly examine, and perhaps

      <div id="calibre_link-239" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Dominant Seventh Chord</p>
        <p class="ctx">We all know that the dominant seventh chord has the power to 
“resolve” to the tonic chord, thus heightening the sense of the tonic as the 
tonal center, but there is not much general agreement as to why it does so. One 
camp says that in a G<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> the F is naturally heard as the seventh 
partial of G (21:16 with C; <em class="calibre3">blu ma</em> to us) because that tone results in a 
pure, beat-less tuning. Another camp says that F is actually the subdominant of 
C (4:3 with C), which not only generates less consonance, but also causes a 
harmonic discontinuity to appear. Notice that, on the harmonic map of G<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>, 
the subdominant tone F is thus a kind of spur of the dominant triad, as example 
32.3 shows.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Some theorists recognize that both explanations are useful, but in differing 
musical contexts. As we have already discussed (in chapters 17 and 26), the 
seventh-partial version is preferred in blues and blues-flavored jazz not only 
on the G triad but also on the C and F triads (the septimal B<span class="fon">b</span> and E<span class="fon">b</span>, 
respectively). The F<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> is specifically <em class="calibre3">not</em> a “dominant seventh” 
chord in that the function of its root is not to fall by a fifth. It rises 
inevitably to the tonic: It is a <em class="calibre3">sub</em>dominant seventh. When one realizes 
that the C<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>, although it has the <em class="calibre3">option</em> of falling a fifth, 
often does not but in fact stands tall as a perfectly correct final chord, one 
realizes the truth: The seventh partial is a <em class="calibre3">blu-</em>blooded native ancestor 
who resides in the overtone series and doesn’t have to “resolve” anywhere.</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">What is less understood is why the 4:3 <em class="calibre3">ma,</em> added to the dominant 
chord, has such a fine resolving power to C. My answer is that the “resolution” 
required to power the perfect cadence is not so much a matter of consonance or 
dissonance as one of harmonic opposition; cadential energy thrives best when its 
harmonic material straddles the tonic along the Pythagorean spine in such a way 
that it <em class="calibre3">collapses</em> toward the center. In the previous chapter we mentioned 
“collapsing” diminished seventh chords; dominant seventh chords provide an even 
more basic example. A dominant triad will fall toward the center in any case; 
but when the subdominant tone is added to the mix, the total force becomes not 
just a fall but a contraction, not unlike the force felt when a rubber band is 
slipped over one’s thumb and index finger and held apart.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Tonality doesn’t depend on rubber bands, it depends on tonal gravity. A 
collapse toward the center is another way of speaking of gravitational 
attraction—in this case, the tonal gravity of the tonic. The sine qua non of 
tonality in music is the tonal gravity of the tonic, just as certainly as the 
sine qua non of earthly life is the gravity of the Earth. Could musical tonality 
be a psychoacoustic metaphor for planetary gravity? Is that why it seems so 
completely to nurture us?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Let us accept as a working hypothesis, at least, that the 4:3 tuning for <em class="calibre3">
ma</em> shown in example 32.3 vivifies the force that drives cadences and 
cadential modulation.</p>

classical music theory has developed a wide variety of misleading concepts, but

theoretically understood as a “chromatic variation” of the minor subdominant

simply “sixth chord” with a “chromatic alteration” of the root, F.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Here we have a clear case of harmonic forces straddling the center. The F<span class="fon">#</span> does not relate primarily to A<span class="fon">b</span> but to C, just as 
surely as the A<span class="fon">b</span> relates to C. The F<span class="fon">#</span> pushes downward as the A<span class="fon">b</span> pulls upward; or one might say that C attracts both tones inward toward itself. The damage is done (and this explains the Doctor’s pique) by a misleading name: To define the F<span class="fon">#</span> in terms of A<span class="fon">b</span> as a root is at best misleading. Harmony students weep with confusion, and rightly so, because the interval of the augmented sixth, which does indeed occur between the A<span class="fon">b</span> and the F<span class="fon">#</span>, is not what structures the sound. What structures the sound is the mixture of overtonal and reciprocal energy within the same (not necessarily triadic) collection of tones. Furthermore, since the chord has come to be conceived as a triad based on A<span class="fon">b</span>, that is, the <span class="fon">b</span>VI triad of C, it looks like this on paper: <span class="fon">b</span>VI<span class="fon">#</span><sup class="calibre19">6</sup>—and when people say it, they tend to refer to the “flat six sharp six chord,” not making a verbal distinction between Roman and Arabic numerals and further confusing 
those they wish to enlighten. File this in the dossier of cases where harmonic 
events are identified by means of melodic, that is, intervalic, names.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If Dr. Overtone were to rename the chord he would look for something like 
“Lydianminor,” but he is not going to try. Would he then have to rename dominant 
seventh chords “dominant-subdominant”? The Doctor realistically, if sadly, 
realizes that pragmatic names for collections of tones, triadic or not, cannot 
convey the entirety of their harmonic significance. We will let “augmented sixth 
chord” stand as an unfortunate fact of language, like someone’s infelicitous 
surname that never goes away: Harold Snide, as fine a valedictorian as ever 
graduated from Analy High. We will also, regretfully, use the conventional “<span class="fon">b</span>VI” to stand for harmony rooted on the minor sixth degree, regardless of the spelling of its 
actual notes.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are three commonly recognized versions of the augmented sixth chord, 
called (with no authentic historical or geographical basis) Italian, German, and 
French; example 32.7 gives all three in the key of C.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 32.8 is the map of all the tones in these three versions combined. The German version makes clear how well the overtonal F<span class="fon">#</span> can mix with the reciprocal pentamerous harmony of the parallel minor of C. To Dr. Overtone’s nearly continuous consternation, the E<span class="fon">b</span> is not only often misspelled as D<span class="fon">#</span> by composers but also 
analyzed by teachers as if the D<span class="fon">#</span> had tonal function in 
C. (Basic misunderstandings like this remind us why resonance needs to be revived.) All of the seventh chords and augmented sixth chords we have been discussing in this chapter are easy to tune and sing. When you experience the true harmony for yourself, the analysis is clear and the misspelling is obvious.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The French version is especially intriguing because of its clear symmetry 
around the dominant, as seen in example 32.9. By looking at the map, you can 
almost feel with your eyes the mutual tug of the tones toward the dominant (to 
which the chord characteristically resolves). The French sixth is actually as 
much a D chord as it is an A<span class="fon">b</span> chord, and the 
lustrous beauty of its tension in just intonation simply cannot be described. It retains much of its allure in equal temperament, and it stands as an elegant model of complementary harmonic tension (as opposed to triadically conceived 
consonance and dissonance) as the engine of cadential energy.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Ambiguity of Function between Dominant Seventh Chords and Augmented Sixth Chords</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is clear by playing a “German sixth” chord at the keyboard that, out of context, it appears to be something much more prosaic, namely an A<span class="fon">b</span><sup class="calibre19">7</sup>, or the V<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> of D<span class="fon">b</span>. And indeed, the <span class="fon">b</span>VI function of an augmented-sixth type chord and the V function of a dominant-seventh type 
chord can, in equal temperament, be magically melded into one event. When that 
happens, the diaschisma is invoked. This is the “more familiar” type of 
diaschismic function I referred to above; we can call it the 
augmented-sixth/dominant-seventh function, or the aug6/7 function. (This will 
sometimes occur with the terms reversed, i.e., “the 7/aug6 function.”)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We are now prepared to examine the array of diaschismas centered around C. A 
diaschisma contains within its compass two major thirds. There are two families 
of diaschismic harmony. As we saw in the case of the Great Diesis, which also 
has two families, what distinguishes one diaschismic family from the other is 
the position of the major thirds in relation to the tonal center.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In the case of a diaschisma, when one major third lies above the central 
spine of fifths and the other lies below, the resulting harmony belongs to the <em class="calibre3">
ga</em>-balanced diaschisma family. The <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-balanced family contains 
examples of both types of diaschismic function we have defined above 
(“Super-Lydian/Phrygian” and “aug6/7”).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When <em class="calibre3">both</em> major thirds lie above the central spine of fifths, the 
resulting harmony belongs to the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> diaschisma family. This family 
contains only type: the aug6/7 function.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I know this is a barrage of information, but the sound of the music itself 
will lead us eventually to a clear perception of diaschismic harmony.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">In bar 1, the F on the third beat is the 4:3 <em class="calibre3">ma</em>. It passes, on the 
next beat, to the 45:32
<em class="calibre3">tivra ma,</em> which sounds simultaneously with the 8:5 A<span class="fon">b</span>, the reciprocal third of C. 
The mixture of overtonal and reciprocal energy is what to listen for. For a 
guaranteed thrill, sing up to the downbeat of bar 3 (but no further for now) 
with two other in-tune friends, and experience the dramatic tension of the A<span class="fon">b</span> and the F<span class="fon">#</span> releasing, by half 
steps in contrary motion, to the octave G. It is this dramatic quality, this 
exquisite pull of opposites in both melodic and harmonic realms, that 
characterizes the “augmented sixth” function. In bar 2, the third pulse 
completes a deceptive cadence, V–<span class="fon">b</span>VI; the harmony of 
bar 1 is reestablished and then, in bar 3, reiterated once again in an 
abbreviated and redistributed form. The bass of the fourth beat of bar 3 is 
heard as F<span class="fon">#</span> at first, since that is 
the context that has been set up, but by the downbeat of bar 4 the ear remembers 
the previous chord not as the 
<span class="fon">b</span>VI<span class="fon">#</span><sup class="calibre19">6</sup> in C but as 
the V<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> of D<span class="fon">b</span>, which uses, as its 
seventh, the 64:45 G<span class="fon">b</span>. This is 
immediately confirmed in the next two beats: We are momentarily perched on D<span class="fon">b</span>. This kind of 
harmonic function is the aug6/7 type of diaschisma. Example 32.11 is a map of 
the diaschisma that occurs between the F<span class="fon">#</span> and the G<span class="fon">b</span>, along with the 
other tones and triads in example 32.10.</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice how the effect of the diaschisma is distributed over the bar line 
between bars 3 and 4. In equal temperament, the clearly overtonal augmented 
fourth becomes the deeply reciprocal diminished fifth with no change of pitch. 
In this study we have so far generally excluded G<span class="fon">b</span> from the tonal 
palette of C because it is almost impossible to recognize without moving the 
tonal center in the reciprocal direction; indeed, in the passage we are 
considering, D<span class="fon">b</span> must be 
convincingly tonicized for the G<span class="fon">b</span> to be evoked and 
the diaschisma to appear. The diaschisma in this example, and generally in this 
type of function in this family, helps to propel us reciprocally away from C.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice also how, at the final beat of bar 4, the alto plays B, the leading 
tone of C. The note is obviously not C<span class="fon">b</span>, and the chord 
containing it is thus correctly named D<span class="fon">b</span><sup class="calibre19">aug6</sup><sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-513"></a><a href="#calibre_link-448">*24</a></sup> 
and not D<span class="fon">b</span><sup class="calibre19">7</sup>, a 
distinction that is made in classical analysis as a matter of course, but never 
in the nomenclature of jazz, contributing both to its pragmatic simplicity and 
its theoretical opacity.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Play this example enough times to clarify the comma; also play the parts 
individually. This type of diaschisma is definitely in the category of tricky 
harmony, the kind that the European ear came to love (and overlove) in the 
nineteenth century. To understand that culture’s music, and the music it 
influenced throughout the world, you need to understand the trick. The <em class="calibre3">best</em> 
trick, however, is to be able to distinguish and identify the characteristic zap 
of the diaschisma so that it becomes a hands-on tool in equal temperament.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We have been emphasizing that there are two types of diaschismic function 
within the
<em class="calibre3">ga</em>-balanced overtonal family. Indeed, both types can occur through the 
agency of the F<span class="fon">#</span>/G<span class="fon">b</span> diaschisma. We have just seen 
an example of the aug6/7 type; example 32.12 shows the Super-Lydian/Phrygian 
type.</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">As in the previous example, the F<span class="fon">#</span> (in bar 1) is the 45:32 augmented fourth, and the G<span class="fon">b</span> (in bar 2) becomes 
the 64:45 diminished fifth. But the triads involved in this harmonic function 
are different from those of the aug6/7 type of function, and the feeling seems 
to be as modal as it is modulatory. (Does it leave C?) Example 32.13 is a 
harmonic map of the tones used in example 32.12. Compare it with example 32.11: 
same diaschismic pair of tones, different harmonic context.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Since the G<span class="fon">b</span> is the tone used in the Phrygian of the subdominant, let’s call this function 
the Lydian/Sub-Phrygian function, to keep it consistent with the name 
Super-Lydian/Phrygian of example 32.2 (which is the same type of harmony but 
lies a fifth higher: two peas in a pod). Notice that the chord on the last pulse 
of bar 2, which in root position would be spelled G<span class="fon">b</span>–B<span class="fon">b</span>–D<span class="fon">b</span>–E, is an augmented sixth chord based on the <span class="fon">b</span>II of F, that 
is, a Phrygian cadence to the subdominant.</p>

the dominant of G Minor (in bar 3), and all this in a single voice. Bach loved 
the harmonic possibilities that exist between two Minor keys separated by two 
fifths (e.g., F Minor and G Minor). As far as we know, he favored temperaments 
that were not equal but weighted toward certain tonal centers (theorists call 
these “well temperaments”; hence the name of Bach’s collection). Throughout his 
music he negotiated all the commas without compromising the spelling. He knew 
precisely what he was hearing. The man tuned his own keyboards; harmonic 
resonance was still alive and well in Bach’s brain. A generation after his death 
in 1750, equal-tempered tuning was becoming the rule rather than the exception. 
Diaschismas were flying about all over Europe, and spelling errors were rife in 
published music. What a blessing and curse is twelve-tone equal temperament!</p>

have already touched on this while learning to sing the diaschisma in just 
intonation. Example 32.19 is the equal-tempered version.</p>

course, part of the twelve-note lattice. The C<span class="fon">#</span> is one fifth beyond the 
overtonal boundary of the twelve-tone lattice, but is convincingly invoked when 
it is closely wedded to the dominant G. The energy of the comma seems to flow 
easily in both directions entirely within the domain of C. Example 32.22 is a

        <p class="calibre5">This may seem like a lot of harmony to learn, and I guess it is; but remember that there are only two different types in this family, a modal type and a 
modulatory type; even if you recognize only one example of each, you still have 
the essence. What remains is largely a matter of repositioning by fifths, which 
changes the flavor but not the essential quality of the harmony. Your best 
strategy is immersion in the music itself. As usual, learn to play the models, 
then elaborate them improvisationally, then experiment on your own. If you are 
unclear about where you are in your travels, check the map.</p>

energy overtonally away from C. It is all clearly modulatory; there are no modal 
examples. Consequently, there is only one type of diaschismic function, namely, 
the 7/aug6 ambiguity. There are three cases only; we will begin with the most 
over-tonal case and work our way down by fifths.</p>

The diaschisma has hurled the energy overtonally away from C. The map of that

        <p class="calibre5">Notice that the symmetry of the diaschismic pair lies precisely around the 
tone B. Realize also that F, that is, the subdominant of C, which has been added 
to the dominant triad G major for cadential efficacy, is allowed by the 
equal-tempered diaschisma to be heard as E<span class="fon">#</span>, the leading tone of 
the dominant of B (one might say the Lydian note of B). It is that very tone, B, 
that stands exactly halfway between the wildly divergent diaschismic partners, 
F/E<span class="fon">#</span>. Furthermore, the 
entire zap is smooth as silk. No muss, no fuss; you thought you were in C, but 
now you are in B Minor, which is, of course, so close to G that you can modulate 
back home through the entirely convincing D<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>–G<sup class="calibre19">7</sup>–C cadence. 
Thus does equal temperament allow E<span class="fon">#</span>, an impossibly distant <em class="calibre3">

connect with and flow effortlessly from F, four perfect fifths and two major 
thirds below. Equal temperament is amazing.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Power of the Diaschisma</p>
        <p class="ctx">In its affective power, the harmony of the diaschisma lies 
somewhere between that of the Didymic comma and the Great Diesis. It is much 
more robust and obstreperous than the Didymic comma, which contains only one 
pure third instead of two, yet it is not so compellingly expressive as the Great 
Diesis, which contains three pure thirds.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although one learns all comma phenomena slowly over the years, it is not 
unusual to learn diaschisma harmony especially slowly. This is undoubtedly due 
not only to its wide range but also to the particulars of its use in actual 
music. The modulatory dominant-seventh/augmented-sixth type of ambiguity that 
was so characteristic of nineteenth century music and the popular forms that 
sprang from it (including popular music appropriated by early jazz musicians) is 
out of fashion today, and when you hear it in contemporary music, it’s often 
perceived as a historical allusion. The modal type of usage is more current, 
however, and remains in the practical lexicon of harmonic moves. Of course, 
harmonic fashions are as predictable as wind. Historical allusion itself, for 
instance, has become fashionable as the twentieth century recedes into the past. 
But don’t be guided by fashion. Learn diaschismic harmony not because it is 
current but because it is part of the geography of the mind.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The good news is that, except for a few nooks and crannies, we have explored 
the entire array of harmonic possibilities in equal-tempered tonality. We won’t

        <p class="ctx">Septimal harmony arises from harmonic ratios that contain the prime seven. It has caught the ear of many contemporary composers who use just intonation; they are quick to point out its undiscovered pleasures and as yet untrammeled byways. But septimal harmony, even in its most basic manifestations, can scarcely be made to appear in equal temperament. The seventh partial of C is thirty-one cents flat from the equal-tempered B<span class="fon">b</span>, more of a divergence from its equal-tempered stand-in than any tone we have met on the five-limit lattice—the 25:24 C<span class="fon">#</span> is a close runner-up at thirty cents, and you remember what a tough time we had bringing <em class="calibre3">it</em> forward in equal temperament. (How the septimal B<span class="fon">b</span> can be invoked on the keyboard is discussed in chapter 26.) The question is, given these very narrow limits, can there ever be a septimal comma in equal temperament? The answer is: In jazz, yes, there are three types of septimal comma, and each type has its own niche in the style.</p>

        <p class="csht">Other Commas</p>
        <p class="ctx">We have discussed the Pythagorean comma in chapter 21 and chronicled its conceptual importance for music theory and its pragmatic importance for tuning. But does it have an artful use in sounding music? I think not. To bring the Pythagorean comma forward, you would have to get my ear around the circle of fifths in a musical manner quickly enough that tonal memory of the starting point remains alive, and although it is easy enough to do this as an exercise (see chapter 41), as a useful musical option it doesn’t occur. Even jazz musicians, who often obsessively practice chords and scales around the circle of fifths, never use it in actual performance or composition except as a stunt.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Are there other functional commas we have not considered? I don’t think so. All the useful combinations of two, three, five, and seven have been considered, and primes past seven cannot be wrung from equal temperament. But, patient reader, you may find one, and if you do, write to Dr. Overtone because the Doctor needs to know.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Of course, on an infinite lattice, an infinite number of commas can be drawn connecting an infinite number of tones, replicating outward from the center until the last trumpet blows. Some of these are fascinating as well as musically useful in just intonation. We are concerned here only with the tonal possibilities of equal temperament. As equal-tempered harmony becomes more and more remote from the tonal center and the forces of tonality loosen, the symmetrical and atonal qualities inherent in equal temperament begin to assert themselves. At present we will be satisfied to go only up to the point where the inherent equality of the temperament begins to swallow up the subtlety of the harmony, and we have reached that point. The cusp between symmetrical harmony and tonal harmony has preoccupied many composers since the late nineteenth century, and it shall preoccupy us as well in the following chapter and in part 4.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">But for now we are fresh out of commas and can take a moment to reflect on the long road we have traveled. Our original purpose was to describe the available tonal possibilities of twelve-tone equal temperament, and we have experienced at least one musical application for each of them. The next thing to do is to draw back and take a look at the overall shape of tonality.</p>

      <p class="ctx">FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD OF THREE DIMENSIONS we have drawn a variety of metaphors for tonal harmony as it sounds in the ear. How literally should we take these descriptions? As literally as is useful. The physical location of music in the brain, and its temporal dynamic there, are neuro-acoustic questions, and at this writing, the answers from an objective view are largely speculative. (This subject reemerges in the afterword.) Although it will someday be illuminating to discover what actually happens in the brain when we hear harmony, what we musicians need now is a reliable visual metaphor, a multidimensional picture that helps us master the tonal language in real time. Three key concepts have helped us build up that picture:</p>
      <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Distinguishing three from five.</em> Our first and most important task in this study has been to distinguish Pythagorean harmonies (generated by the prime three) from pentamerous harmonies (generated by the prime five) at every level of musical structure—from overtones and dronal dyads all the way to the most complex modulations of equal temperament. Everything depends on this discernment between three-generated and five-generated tones. Most of the inaccuracies, confusions, and disappointments of classical analysis can be traced to the undervaluation of this distinction. We have approached the matter not as a more or less attractive intellectual construct but as sensual experience: We feel the numbers and the numbers feel good. As direct descendants of the first musicians to draw notes from hollow reeds, we remain true to the sensual pragmatism of our nature. As we follow this path of number feeling through the music of the world, we realize that human ears are amazingly more the same than different. Most of us love low-prime harmonies and use them in our music without surcease to nurture ourselves and our children.</p>
      <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">The two-dimensional lattice.</em> A huge conceptual leap is made from the sensual qualities of low-prime harmonies to the construction of a two-dimensional five-limit lattice. Once you have drawn a lattice you have a shape in space. The ephemeral becomes substantial; patterns of waves become a thing on paper, a thing with a function. If there were no other components to the tonal architecture than <em class="calibre3">pa</em> and <em class="calibre3">ga</em> (plus their compounds and reciprocals), then our functional picture would be complete. The entire harmonic universe would be as flat as the page: a five-limit lattice in a two-dimensional plane, extending indefinitely.</p>
      <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Tonal gravity.</em> To this basic picture we can add an additional quality, “the love of the center,” the reflection of our desire to return to home: tonal gravity. From the moment a piece of tonal music begins, a center establishes itself, from which emanates a field of attraction. In this, the tonic is not unlike the nucleus of an atom or the sun of a solar system. Substituting magnetism for gravity, one might imagine the force field of the lattice as the iron filings that pattern themselves around a pair of magnets. It is a joy to witness a child’s first play with two magnets: She holds the objects apart from one another experiencing for herself the mysterious invisibility of the forces between them. She invests the space between the objects with physical characteristics: color, dynamic lines, magic beings. Likewise, we can observe our own wonder as we gradually become aware of the pull of the tonal center—from the first perception of leading-tone-to-tonic, to our first comprehension of perfect and full cadences, and finally to the elaborate tonal schemes of classical literature. We are just like kids playing with magnets, and the wonder of it is the essence of our work.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">The staff notation we have developed to demonstrate the lattice is a practical hands-on tool, but it is misleading in at least one particular: This magnetic pull is not proportionately represented. As tones compound, the attractive force of the center upon them decreases exponentially (as is approximated by the increasing distances between planets as one moves away from the sun), not arithmetically (as the even spacing of staff notation implies). What would happen, for instance, if we drew a spine of fifths whose tones were placed proportionately according to the ratios (that is, where G were three units from C, D were nine units, A were twenty-seven units, etc.) and a spine of thirds where E were five units from C, G<span class="fon">#</span> were twenty-five units, and so on? It would look something like example 34.1.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p class="calibre5">This representation is still inaccurate in at least two ways: <em class="calibre3">Pa</em> compounds more easily than <em class="calibre3">ga</em> (27:16 is much more common than 25:16), and the ear hears overtones more easily than it hears reciprocal tones. Yet even without any proportional modifications, the essential graphic metaphor of a two-dimensional lattice, ruled by tonal gravity, remains viable.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-253" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Folding Plane</p>
        <p class="ctx">Music in just intonation that moves through a comma does not alter this essential picture. Singing through a Didymic comma, for instance, transports the singer by a large harmonic distance of four perfect fifths up plus one major third down by means of a small change in pitch, and the movement through the territory is entirely trackable on the lattice. So if there were no such thing as temperament, our picture of five-limit harmony would be functionally complete: It is a flat plane through which the ear travels in a variety of ways.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Temperament, however, alters the essential nature of the picture. To better understand how, let’s choose the example of the Great Diesis partners G<span class="fon">#</span> and A<span class="fon">b</span>. In equal temperament they are the same pitch. To represent this identity, let us investigate what the lattice would look like if G<span class="fon">#</span> and A<span class="fon">b</span> would momentarily <em class="calibre3">touch</em>. The plane would have to fold up like a book, or a pancake. Imagine that the point at which C is located is immobile, and that the locations of G<span class="fon">#</span> (north) and A<span class="fon">b</span> (south) rise up, fold toward one another, and their energies touch; then the pancake unfolds and lies flat again. Remember that music takes place through time, and that commas dispense their energies as musical contexts change. In just intonation, the singer simply moves from point A to point B on a two-dimensional lattice. But in equal temperament a single pitch functions for both tones, and the entire plane folds and unfolds as the musical context—and hence the function of the fixed pitches—changes. Our new picture is a 3-D movie of a folding and unfolding plane.<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-517"></a><a href="#calibre_link-455">*28</a></sup></p>
        <p class="calibre5">As long as equal-tempered music is 100 percent nonambiguous (the way we practiced it in the first four chapters of part 2), the lattice remains flat. When equal-tempered ambiguity appears, the various commas also appear, and each kind of comma folds the lattice in its own characteristic way so that its pairs of tones can touch and zap. As the significance of the zap clarifies, the plane becomes flat again. That is the secret of how Pathfinder gets home: A new dimension comes into the story, transforming the capabilities of the original dimensions.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-254" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The View from the Center</p>
        <p class="ctx">It may be helpful to imagine that you are Homebody standing at your hearth right on C, in the middle of a lattice that is a vast plain, a prairie stretching on all sides as far as the eye can see. (We will do our imagining in staff orientation.) When a pair of tones is about to participate in a zap they get a little excited and rise up out of the plain a bit, like small volcanoes. You can see them both at once. In the case of the G<span class="fon">#</span>/A<span class="fon">b</span> diesis, you see the G<span class="fon">#</span> volcano way off to your north (and slightly east) and the A<span class="fon">b</span> volcano to your south (and slightly west), not nearly so far. You know that Pathfinder is off to the north, approaching the G<span class="fon">#</span> volcano. First you see a puff of smoke, then sparks, then suddenly the ground curves upward in both directions, up over your head. You look straight up—amazing sight!—blazing volcanoes from the north and the south approach each other, their fires blend in a flash, and then, abruptly, the sky looks normal again and the prairie is just a prairie. “No wonder he loses it every time,” you think, as Pathfinder, slightly punchy, gallops up from the south.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Still standing in Homebody’s position by the hearth on the prairie, imagine the same scenario but with a different kind of folding: the Didymic kind. Say the two tones are the Didymic pair of D’s, 10:9 and 9:8. Instead of thrusting up from the distant north and the near south, the ground curves up from the middle-near northwest (10:9) and the middle-near northeast (9:8). The motion is gentle, less disturbing, more light than fire. What if the Didymic pair of ii <em class="calibre3">triads</em> were involved—whole counties would gently rise up to touch and exchange energy.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Next, consider the diaschismic kind of folding. The diaschismic pair C<span class="fon">#</span>/D<span class="fon">b</span> would have the distant northeast and the middle-far southwest arching up and meeting. I’ll leave the qualitative adjectives up to you. Let your imagination be guided by the affective quality of the diaschisma.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-255" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">A Picture of Three Commas</p>
        <p class="ctx">As music becomes harmonically more complex, various commas can pile one on top of another, or even dovetail, or conceivably nest inside one another. It becomes increasingly difficult, even for the topologically inclined, to imagine any folding of the lattice corresponding to such comma activity. Therefore it may be useful to have a clear perception of all three functional commas simultaneously in two-dimensional, static space. Example 34.2 is a diagram of a Didymic comma (between the 9:8 D and the 10:9 D), a Great Diesis (between the 25:16 G<span class="fon">#</span> and the 8:5 A<span class="fon">b</span>), and a diaschisma (between the 135:128 C<span class="fon">#</span> and the 16:15 D<span class="fon">b</span>), all seen simultaneously.</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The purpose of this diagram is to get you to consider, in your mind’s eye, the simultaneous potential of these three commas. They don’t all happen at once; I just want you to see them all at once. Later on (in chapter 41) certain specific combinations will be demonstrated. In addition, the Pythagorean comma, which I have omitted here, will be included in the discussion. (I realize that within the construct of this spatial model, envisioning the septimal comma is problematic, since we have already assigned the third dimension to the property of folding.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As the harmonic ambiguities of equal-tempered tonal music are worked out through time, the harmonic territory becomes flat and variously folded by turns. This working out is both apocalyptic and effortless at the same time—that’s how life is on the prairie. Perhaps this way of imagining such events—by literally standing under them—is one way of understanding them.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-256" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Position and Expressivity</p>
        <p class="ctx">There is one more distinguishing characteristic of tonal harmony that we have observed but barely discussed: the relation between position and expressivity. It is hardly possible to define, much less to quantify, the psychological and emotional responses that various tones evoke. It is even likely that responses vary considerably from culture to culture and from individual to individual within a given culture. As was pointed out in the introduction, this is the problem with a theory of affects: Its logical consequence is a standard of response and the subsequent deployment of the Affect Police. Nevertheless, it seems to be generally true that as tones are positioned closer to the center they seem stronger, more stable and more structural; and as they move farther away they become weaker and less stable and more expressive. The more distant a tone is from the center, the more potential it has for the deep evocation of complex feeling. The <em class="calibre3">least</em> expressive tone is <em class="calibre3">sa; pa</em> is a close runner up. These tones do not channel emotional energy so much as disperse it; they release tension and return composure to the body. It is the far-out tones in the outlying provinces, like the 25:24 C<span class="fon">#</span> from <em class="calibre3">Ga-Ga</em> Land, or the extreme Pythagorean 243:128 leading tone B, or even the Dark Sister 10:9 D, that throw us to our extremes, make us long for resolution, and induce trill-like flutterings and tremblings in our bodies.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">But there is also this to consider: The greater the distance, the weaker the signal. As the evocative qualities become more intense and complex, their force gradually attenuates, until finally, as the distance passes beyond the domain of the tonic, the harmonic thread breaks and the emotional complexity becomes merely incomprehensible, a kind of noise, an out-of-tuneness. The dialectical force between the complex, fence-sitting responses from far-out tones and the simple, certain pleasures from close-in tones is one of music’s greatest sophistications. This oppositional balance is a special aspect of the tonal gravity that exists within the dynamically folding lattice.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Dark Side</p>
        <p class="ctx">The ear is deep; it is difficult to overestimate the collective profundity of the ear. And the depth of the ear’s musical response is cumulatively enhanced and nurtured by culture, passed on from one person to the next, from generation to generation. I am alive in the first generation of ears that can listen to the greatest master musicians of virtually every culture and subculture. For a few dollars I can buy recordings of the best musicians in the world, some of whom are long gone from us. The more I listen the more I can hear the wit, pathos, and intellectual complexity that connects the Australian aborigine’s didjeridoo and the European conductor’s baton, and the more I realize that there is only one pair of ears.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What continually amazes me is the fierce love of harmonic resonance that is evident everywhere. Not all music has the complex tonal system or the counterpoint of the European legacy, or the modal variety of India, or the rhythmic complexity of Ghana, but everywhere one listens one hears the same passionate intelligence. The most subtle conceivable nuances of intonation are shared worldwide. It becomes apparent that our one pair of ears recognizes how wide harmonic territories can be traversed by small melodic intervals. Even in music that does not require commas, micro-intervals that radically affect the harmonic flow show up again and again. This is true for the best musicians regardless of culture or style—the hip pop singer in the recording booth no less than the muezzin in the tower or the cellist in the concert hall. Worldwide listening reveals that master musicians sing and play the gamut running from the dead-in-tuneness of low-prime norms, through harmonic complexities of every sort, all the way to momentary, deliberate out-of-tuneness. Playing with simple, pure harmonies is like playing with light, and the fascination with that cusp between complexity and out-of-tuneness is like playing on the dark side. The flirtation between the light and the dark is a kind of confrontation with destiny itself, a reenactment of the battle between survival and annihilation, harmony and noise. We cherish this in our music. As long as we are singing about life and death we know we are still alive. The various commas, whether they are used as expressive shading or as a functional way of zapping through harmonic territory, far from being the pesky problems that many theorists have assumed them to be, are in fact windows to the affective dark side of the psyche, and they enable music to fill up to the brim with the full range of human feeling.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Even the commas implicit in twelve-tone equal temperament imbue equal-tempered music with a tremendous range of human response. We need to elevate the status of the equal-tempered comma from that of a pun, where a single thing stands for two incidentally related things, to that of matchmaker, where complementary energies are conjoined and synthesized into a higher meaning.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-258" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Ambiguity at the Center</p>
        <p class="ctx">Tonality is predicated on the immutability of the central tone. Up to this point, we have held to the premise that whatever else happens, the center does not move. But what would happen if there were ambiguity at the center?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are two kinds of tonic ambiguity: contiguous and noncontiguous. Contiguous ambiguity means that the tonic can move about within a neighborhood of tones that are harmonically bonded on the lattice. For instance, within the neighborhood of C Major the tonal center might move from C to G, or from C to A. In the neighborhood of C Minor, the tonal center might move from C to E<span class="fon">b</span>, or C to B<span class="fon">b</span>. Although this implies that there are many common tones within such shifts, not all the tones involved need to be in common. We have already discussed the oscillation between C Major pentatonic and A Minor pentatonic that includes four (not five) common tones. C Major and F Lydian, for another example, also share the same neighborhood, but with only five (not seven) common tones (or perhaps six common tones, depending on the tuning of the D). In some music, especially Medieval European music, the tonic is more like an area, a neighborhood of interrelated tones, affording various combinations of initial and final tonics. It is as if you ask the music where it lives, and instead of giving a street address, it says, “Around here.” This practice attenuates the force of tonality and, within a restricted area, allows it to float. Floating tonality both expands and softens the tonal experience but does not essentially challenge its premise.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Noncontiguous ambiguity is another story. Here is a typical scenario: You begin in C Minor and wander on a continuous journey that comes to an end in, say, B Major—the musical equivalent, for the protagonist, of exile. It doesn’t feel bad, necessarily, it just doesn’t feel right. Not surprisingly, such journeys are rarely made in music, although a scurrilous exception is the show tune practice of raising the final chorus by a half step, a superficial boost in energy. Scenarios like the following, however, are common in equal temperament: Pathfinder starts out from C Minor and wends pentamerously southward, say, to A<span class="fon">b</span> Major, then to A<span class="fon">b</span> Minor, then to F<span class="fon">b</span> Major (follow this!), then to F<span class="fon">b</span> Minor, and finally, by way of A<span class="fon">º</span> Major, to D<span class="fon">º</span> Minor. That’s it—the piece is over. Pathfinder makes his usual reentrance and discovers Homebody at the hearth pouring tea, smiling as usual. But there is something strange about her smile. And what’s this? <em class="calibre3">It’s not real lemon</em>—it’s from frozen concentrate. He squints at Homebody. “Are you sure you’re you?” he asks timidly. “And what about yourself?” she replies sweetly. Then, as Pathfinder sinks down into his trusted armchair, <em class="calibre3">it</em> feels strange, and he realizes that although he is home, he is not home. “Ah, well,” he muses, “it’s been a great trip.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Of course, Pathfinder has <em class="calibre3">not</em> found his way back to the home he started from; he has arrived at the home of his comma sibling, in this case, the D<span class="fon">º</span> a Great Diesis distant. The equal-tempered pitch is identical, but the harmony is disparate; the ambiguity is noncontiguous, that is, not in the immediate neighborhood of the initial tonic. Pathfinder is satisfied with his surrogate home in a way; it is not unpleasant, and he is indeed oddly—very oddly—stimulated to be so near and yet so far. But he is simultaneously annoyed. Something is missing: It’s the clarity. Where is that reassuring, level gaze of recognition? Where is the Homebody he left behind? “Ah, well,” he sighs again, ruminating over his travels, which damn near tore him apart, “it’s good to be virtually home.”</p>

        <p class="csht">Virtual Return</p>
        <p class="ctx">As soon as equal temperament appears, so does the phenomenon of <em class="calibre3">virtual return.</em> What a development this is in our history! Both feet have left Eden; our innocence is finished. By the early 1800s it had become commonplace for instrumental music to begin in one key and end many commas distant, the displacement often marked by an “enharmonic change,” that is, an addition or subtraction of twelve accidentals to the key signature (the six sharps of F<span class="fon">#</span> Major become the six flats of G<span class="fon">b</span> Major). The first movement of Beethoven’s “Appassionata” Sonata, Op. 57, for instance, begins in F Minor and ends, after adding twenty-four flats, in A<span class="fon">º</span><span class="fon">º</span> Minor (A-quadruple-flat Minor)—pure fodder for those who nurture their inner double flat. Even though the pitch of A<span class="fon">º</span><span class="fon">º</span> and F are the same, I think the effect of such virtual returns on the listeners of two hundred years ago was probably revolutionary, extraordinary, stimulating, and disturbing. Even today, if you compare two pieces of modulatory keyboard music, one with an actual return (like the models given at the end of chapter 22) and one with a virtual return, the difference in affect is clear. I think that, historically, virtual return was an artistic and psychological epiphany and the harbinger of modern music. It stated that the center does not always hold, that for the sake of the journey we will sacrifice the integrity of the hearth, in the name of progress we will compromise purity of heart. This is not to rail against progress (I do love my Beethoven, and my Bartók, too) but to describe, in harmonic terms, what actually happened.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In our time we have learned that, to cope with progress, ancient values and inner traditions need to be continually reaffirmed. At the turn of the twenty-first century, the pleasures of “virtual reality” are coming under scrutiny; they are suspected of being the inferior substitutes characteristic of ersatz reality—not an essential abstraction so much as a dangerously incomplete imitation. People are wary. Likewise, there is a strong trend among some musicians against harmonic virtual return. It’s OK to leave Eden, but not to forget the way back; we want to hold open the option of claiming the Homebody we left behind. And so resonance revives, and dronality and harmonically contiguous tonality become once again common practice. These were never lost, of course, not even in Western concert music, just dozing beneath the crust of the times.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-260" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Value of Ambiguity</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is in any case fascinating and fulfilling to experience and understand ambiguity of the tonic as a dramatic—even dark—force in music. The mutability of the tonic shakes up the harmonic ground, which in turn shakes up the psyche. The commas of equal temperament can spin that ground in circles of thirds or fifths, extruding the psyche by centrifugal force, exposing what was hidden. It is no wonder that spinning tonality and symmetrical modes developed in Europe alongside conceptual models of the unconscious mind. There are places in Beethoven where you can sense the composer’s almost physical grasp of his own unconscious; his music exteriorizes and embraces the inner dark with the same passionate focus that Freud displays in his quest for a functional science of it. In this sense, the weakening and eventual loss (in twentieth-century atonality) of the tonal center can be seen as a kind of survival tool, a highly specialized way of gaining sufficient self-knowledge to stave off self-destruction. Just as psychotherapy is a tool for living, so can the harmonic ambiguities that lead to symmetrical and atonal harmony be a tool for inner sight. Whatever your aesthetic inclinations, it is valuable to broaden your harmonic study past tonal harmony into symmetrical harmony and atonality in order to find your bearings in the whole of the culture’s legacy, and in the whole of yourself.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Best Strategy</p>
        <p class="ctx">Perhaps now that the picture of tonal harmony is fleshed out with folded planes, temporal dynamism, and psychoemotional force fields, the best strategy is to close your eyes, listen to a favorite piece of music, forget everything we’ve said, and simply observe what happens to you. These pictures we have called forth are meant only as aides to get you closer to the essence of music, including your own music, and must not be mistaken for it. Music is ultimately itself. Even after fifty years of musical training, sometimes I haven’t the foggiest idea what I’m listening to, and I like it that way. These moments of pure listening are when I learn the most, I think. But there comes a day when you need a picture, and we have drawn it and animated it.</p>

      <p class="ctx">OUR AIM IS TO WEAVE THE HARMONIC MATERIAL we have been studying into hands-on, real-time daily musical life. Intellectual comprehension is not enough to attain this, nor are peak harmonic experiences. Fluency is crucial.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Chapter 35 deals with certain general problems of harmonic practice, especially the relation between name and sound. Following this are seven chapters dealing with harmonic practice, progressing from diatonic sequences (chapter 36) through cadential practices (chapters 37 and 38), modulatory practices (chapters 39 and 40), cyclic sequences (chapter 41), and finally, practices in symmetrical harmony (chapter 42). Chapter 43 demonstrates certain new analytical procedures using examples from various musical periods. Chapter 44 is a summary of the theory. So now is the time to attend to some practical matters.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-265" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Coexistence of Just Intonation and Equal Temperament</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is natural to wonder if your sensitivity to the affective lacework of just intonation will be compromised—or ruined—by the rough edges of equal temperament. Or, more grievously, whether a lifetime of acculturation to equal temperament has inured you to its imprecision. The larger question is, Are the two systems mutually exclusive, or is there a productive area of mutual existence?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Historically, many have approached the two systems as if they were natural antagonists, as opposed to one another as rational and irrational numbers. There is no dearth of theorists (Easley Blackwood, for instance) eager to demonstrate the futility of trying to retune, according to just ratios, music originally intended for equal temperament. Others (Alain Daniélou, for instance) simply dismiss equal temperament as a spoiler of the natural ear, a kind of pollution rising up from the skyline of modern music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Each of these points of view is only too true. Anyone who has tried will soon realize the impossibility of rendering Beethoven, or even Schütz, in just intonation. Aside from the pitch problems that arise in exposing the commas, it is the very quality of the temperament itself, as we have begun to see in this study, that imbues such music with much of its character. And as for equal temperament ruining ancient sensibilities, the presence of equal-tempered harmoniums has seriously compromised North Indian raga; equal-tempered electronic keyboards have deeply bled the celebratory and the sacred from African music. To hear this for yourself, all you have to do is compare modern versions with early recordings or with extant versions of traditional music. Inside the rough-beating intervals of equal temperament you can hear bulldozers leveling villages to make room for shopping malls: The shamans want to be paid in Levis. The curious thing is how many of the young musicians not only don’t seem to mind but even enjoy the newfangled way of doing business. Meanwhile, in the dim corners of longhouses, elders are longing to hear what they will never hear again.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If you draw back far enough, however, another perspective comes into view. In situations where just intonation and equal temperament have had many generations to accommodate to one another, extremely productive alliances have been made. This is in part the result of a serendipitous psycho-acoustic phenomenon. In most music, a discrimination is made between foreground and background. The ear focuses on the foreground, examines it closely, wants it to be in tune, and doesn’t forgive much. But the ear is considerably more tolerant of the background. Specifically, it forgives tuning differences between the foreground and the background. That means that a truly in-tune soprano can sing a Mozart aria in front of an orchestra and perfectly peg every last heart-wrenching, pentamerously affective tone even if the orchestra accompanies her in something much closer to equal temperament. Will there be differences between the soloist’s just thirds and the orchestra’s wide thirds? Yes. Will the ear forgive the differences and respond to the true ratios? Yes. What if the loudness of the foreground and the background were equal, the ear hearing the soprano no more prominently than, say, the violas? The performance would then sound out of tune.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This phenomenon is easy to ascertain in the present era of multitrack recording, where the mixer has independent control over foreground and background. There exists, in fact, a particular balance between foreground and background that optimizes the tuning, and this balance is the musical ideal.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The alliance between just intonation and equal temperament has had well over a hundred years to mature in the African/European mixture that has become jazz. The wailing seventh partials of the old blues belters and the equal-tempered seventh chords of the pianists were out of tune with each other, but the ear is drawn by the longing of the blues resonances at the same time it is led by the harmonic logic of the equal-tempered accompaniment. Throughout the history of jazz, players of equal-tempered instruments and players of variable pitch instruments (including singers) have learned to find the <em class="calibre3">optimal tuning</em> for the circumstances.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Optimal tuning uses the best of both worlds: the modulations of equal temperament and the affective resonances of just intonation, adjusting moment by moment according to the musical conditions. Are there ever direct confrontations that have no solution? Indeed. One such circumstance can occur when a jazz acoustic (or fretless) bassist is close-miked (or direct-miked) and accompanying a piano soloist, doubling the pianist’s bass notes. The bassist will either play in equal temperament (some may be unable and few would be willing to do so) or accept being out of tune with the pianist’s bass line. (The solution: They should share fewer pitches.) There are worse cases: Sarod and piano is not a great bet except in cases of heroic restraint. But generally speaking, optimal tuning is common practice for sensitive musicians in every style (including especially pop music) whenever equal-tempered and variable-pitch instruments are combined.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Tuning problems can arise even within just intonation, of course. In contemporary performances of Medieval music (and most likely in Medieval performances as well) the lutes and harps typically tune in a modified Pythagorean tuning—a long spine of fifths with a note or two fudged toward the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> side—while the singers and vielle players tend toward pure thirds. You can hear the pitch differences between singers (loud) and harp (soft) if you are listening that way, but the music implores you to appreciate the pentamerous feeling as well as the Pythagorean structure. The performers’ responsibility is to maintain an acoustic balance that enhances both aspects. It is done intuitively: One seeks the best sound.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Each individual needs to find the solution to the tuning problems that are generated by his or her music. My own case: Piano is my primary instrument, but I am renewed and inspired by singing in just intonation against a drone. When I need the truth of just resonances in my music, one method is to select tones on the keyboard that are mostly within the central Pythagorean spine of whatever key I am in, thereby giving my voice leeway to sing overtonal and reciprocal <em class="calibre3">ga</em>’s without conflict. That way I can modulate anywhere and sing whatever I want wherever I land. Another method that minimizes tuning discrepancies is to play soft, close-spaced clusters as a vocal accompaniment. But these are the tricks of one musician. My advice: Don’t sweat the tuning problem. When you are making music in just intonation, enjoy it. When you are playing in equal temperament, use the temperament well and enjoy it also. If you are conversant with both systems, you will find ways of integrating them; your optimal tuning will appear. Meanwhile, mutual respect avoids conflict. As long as your ears are alive to the resonances of just intonation and aware of the spells and potions of equal temperament, one system need not be counterproductive in relation to the other. In fact, there are undoubtedly beautiful, useful ways of combining prime-number tunings with various temperaments that have yet to be explored. (This subject will surface again in the afterword.)</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-267" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Nomenclature</p>
        <p class="ctx">Adam’s job in the Garden of Eden was naming all the plants and animals. Likewise, for most musicians, tending our gardens is not enough; we need to name the things we find growing there. (Since you’ve stayed with me this far, I assume you feel this need, too.) Following are some observations on the tricky practice of naming things in music.</p>
        <p class="csht1">GRABBERS</p>
        <p class="ctx">As harmonic complexity deepens, the issue first raised in the introduction is brought front and center once more: “Why name it?” This time around we will approach the main question with a related one: “Why name it falsely?” I am referring to the kind of name that musicians sometimes call “grabbers.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A grabber is a name that may be extrinsic to the thing named (like a mnemonic), or is incomplete, misleading, or even false, but that nonetheless immediately tags a musical event and allows the musician to grab it in real time. For keyboard players especially, the payoff of wrapping your fingers around the necessary notes, regardless of method, is compelling. The black-and-white topography of the keyboard is itself a grabber: We memorize in part by the pattern of keys as we see them with our eyes and move among their hillocks and canyons with our fingers. Even fingerings are a way of remembering music. Chord symbols of all types are functional filing systems for the musical brain in action. The names of scales and modes serve likewise—we ourselves have contrived some bizarre ones (see chapter 12). To the question “Should we tolerate grabber names—or any names—that are a barrier to analytical insight?” we must answer, “Yes and no.” Yes, if the name takes you closer to that point of clarity where all names are transcended; everything is fair if you win that game. No, if the name gets you stuck so that you cannot conceptualize—or hear—beyond the name.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">An example of yes: Jazz musicians call a certain scale the “altered” scale (see chapter 37). The name is wrong in that it suggests an alteration from a norm that doesn’t exist (altered from what?), but it does as little harm as a nickname (Bucky), or those persistent family names (Bobums) that arise from a younger sibling’s inability to pronounce a proper name. An example of no: Jazz musicians also call the middle chord in example 35.1 “G<sup class="calibre19">7(</sup><span class="fon">#</span><sup class="calibre19">9)</sup>,” which implies that the top note is A<span class="fon">#</span>.</p>

            <b class="calibre8">Example 35.1</b>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">A<span class="fon">#</span> is what that note is not; it is the seventh degree (B<span class="fon">b</span>) of the approaching tonic (C). The correct name is G<sup class="calibre19">7(</sup><span class="fon">b</span><sup class="calibre19">10)</sup>—no more difficult to say, write, or think than the incorrect one. Dr. Overtone and his cohorts must defend this correct name, since it leads to the constructive harmonic analysis that its evil twin obfuscates forever.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The truth is that all names lie; even pictures lie. But names and images are the kinds of lies that can lead you closer to the ideal; in this case the ideal is for music to arise from all modes of perception. On the way to the ideal, names, including grabbers, can play a crucial role. Every musician must decide when the convenience of a false name so undermines its utility that it must be abandoned or changed.</p>
        <p class="csht1">“HARMONIC” VERSUS “MELODIC”</p>
        <p class="ctx">Throughout this book we have been trying to bend the meanings of <em class="calibre3">harmonic</em> and <em class="calibre3">melodic</em> apart from one another. <em class="calibre3">Harmonic</em> is used in its sense of “agreement” between two or more tones, a relationship that can be described in proportionate ratios. <em class="calibre3">Melodic</em> is used to refer to the mere up-and-down-ness of a line of tones, a linear proximity that can be measured intervalically by counting steps. The aesthetics of up-and-down-ness can easily be seen in the outlines of distant mountains, just as it can be heard in the songs of wolves. All up-and-down-ness is not equally pleasing: Certain mountain views are more “scenic” than others. Perhaps breath and other metabolic functions are internal norms of reference that guide us in this response. In any case, the difference between a wolf song and an art song is essentially the agreement, in the latter, of the tones with one another: They have harmony. The musical quality that people ordinarily identify as “melodic,” as in “what a gorgeous melody,” is, according to our definition, actually an artistic combination of both melodic and harmonic components. It is the function of analysis to sort out what the ear naturally conjoins.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">One of the most fundamental musical rules is, “Steps are easy, leaps are hard.” In <em class="calibre3">melodic</em> space, this means that the ear hears tones as connected when they are distant by a half step or a whole step; unrelenting leaps of fourths, fifths, and larger intervals are hard to hear, hard to sing, and generally less melodic. In <em class="calibre3">harmonic</em> space, “steps easy, leaps hard” means that matchstick relationships, especially Pythagorean ones, are heard as connected, and that the farther away on the lattice two chord roots are, the more leapy and hard to comprehend is the harmony. In music generally, when something is difficult in one dimension, the other dimensions are made easy; the rule is, “Don’t do two difficult things at once.” This means that a melodic leap is most easily heard in the context of a harmonic step (or when the harmony stands still), and a harmonic leap is best understood when the melody is stepwise (or stands still). That is why arpeggios can so easily occur against standing harmony, and why, when the chord does change, especially radically, the melody typically moves by a step.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">An enormous conceptual barrier is raised when a harmonic leap is misidentified as a melodic step, and it happens all the time. For instance, many would say that in the progression Cmi to G<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> to A<span class="fon">b</span>, the harmony “works” because “it is just a half step” between G and A<span class="fon">b</span>. The half step helps the harmony seem close, but we are responding as well, if not primarily, to the purely harmonic aspects: We have fallen suddenly into reciprocal, pentamerous territory, and the G<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> and the A<span class="fon">b</span> want to harmonically collapse toward the tonic.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A similarly egregious misconception results when music such as example 35.2 is said to make “smooth” harmony.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Actually, it makes jagged harmony, as a check on the lattice will show. What it does make is creamy smooth, thick melody. In fact, it sacrifices harmonic organization for the simplicity of mere up-and-down-ness, which can be quite pleasing. Such parallel harmony is common in music, from early organum to fauxbourdon to big-band jazz (where it is called a “thickened line”).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In order to understand harmony most fully, one must separate the purely harmonic from the purely melodic. Then the mutual influence of harmony and melody on one another clarifies.</p>
        <p class="csht1">“TONAL” VERSUS “CHROMATIC”</p>
        <p class="ctx">A related confusion exists between the terms <em class="calibre3">chromatic,</em> which refers basically to the smallest incremental up-and-down-ness of melodic space, and <em class="calibre3">tonal.</em> Often people will explain a passage by saying “it’s simply chromatic,” as if there were no further analyzable <em class="calibre3">tonal</em> context. Very little that is simply chromatic occurs in tonal music. Play example 35.3.</p>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Although example 35.4 contains chromatic semitones, these have <em class="calibre3">tonal</em> function. The passage is fully <em class="calibre3">tonal</em>, and it also happens to be chromatic, but it is the combination of tonal function and the many semitones that give the passage its character, not simply the semitones. Chords or tones may appear to be chromatic on the page, but they are not “simply chromatic” unless the tonal context has disappeared, which of course does happen in twentieth-century music. But whenever there is even the slightest hint of tonal context, it should be accounted for harmonically and spelled accordingly.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are legitimate uses of the term <em class="calibre3">chromatic.</em> Any two tones a semitone apart that share the same letter name, such as F and F<span class="fon">#</span>, are chromatic pairs. But be wary in thinking that tonal territory can be usefully described by calling it chromatic. Be especially wary of the term “chromatic alteration,” or “chromatically altered chords.” This is like calling a complex person a deviant: The term suggests what the person is not, with no reference to what he is. (Chapter 42 deals in some detail with the tonal function of chromatic and other symmetrical scales.)</p>
        <p class="csht1">SPELLING AND MISSPELLING</p>
        <p class="ctx">We have already railed (especially in chapter 15) about misspellings. They occur for two reasons: ignorance and convenience. The former is both forgivable and reparable. But when clarity of harmonic function is intentionally sacrificed for a cleaner page or a superficially easier reading, Dr. Overtone places his foot squarely down. Composers and performers alike should demand spelling that indicates lattice position as correctly as possible; much more is gained in true understanding of the harmonic environment than is gained in the name of convenience.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There is, it is true, a limit to the number of double flats and double sharps one can recognize, and enharmonic change is sometimes needed. There are some keys—B, F<span class="fon">#</span>, G<span class="fon">b</span>, and D<span class="fon">b</span> especially—wherein even moderately rangey harmony incurs a plethora of double accidentals; for these keys there is often no completely satisfactory solution. Also, in cases of tonal ambiguity there is often no best option. But as a rule, insistence upon the spelling that most easily facilitates positional analysis will result in deeper musical insight, which ultimately means better composition and better performance.</p>
        <p class="csht1">KEY AND MODE</p>
        <p class="ctx">A particularly foggy patch of nomenclature lies between <em class="calibre3">key</em> and <em class="calibre3">mode. Key,</em> in its narrowest (and clearest) definition, refers to the tonic of an unspecified scale. “The key of C” means that the tone C is the center of tonal gravity, but it offers no information about the other scale degrees. (<em class="calibre3">Keynote</em> and <em class="calibre3">tonic</em> mean the same thing.) A <em class="calibre3">mode</em> is best thought of as a collection, or set, of tones that clusters about, or associates with, the tonic. The modal maps in chapters 11 and 12 give a clear representation of this; the Magic Mode is an expansion of the concept. (A <em class="calibre3">scale</em> refers to the tones of a mode arranged in alphabetical order). Unfortunately, the common usage of <em class="calibre3">key</em> has been extended beyond its primary meaning to include mode as well: “The key of C,” for instance, conventionally means the white notes, with C as the tonic. The full name would be “key of C, Major mode,” just as we would more naturally say, “key of C, Phrygian mode.” The shortened terms “C Major” and “C Phrygian” are of course more convenient, but the distinction between key and mode must be kept clear in one’s thinking.</p>
        <p class="csht1">TONIC, ROOT, AND BASS</p>
        <p class="ctx">There are three types of reference points used for musical naming: <em class="calibre3">tonic</em> (what key you are in), <em class="calibre3">root</em> (the letter name or Roman numeral name of the chord you are on), and <em class="calibre3">bass</em> (the lowest sounding tone). These locations are nested one inside the next. We are familiar with nested locations: You live in a country, in a state, in a town, on a street, in a house; you are in a room, sitting on a chair. It is natural for us to say, “I am in the northern part of the country, in the southern part of the state, on the west side of town, watching the sunrise from the east bedroom.” In music, likewise, we are in the key of C Minor, on the chord of G major (also called the V chord), whose third (B) is in the bass. We are singing the tone D, and understand our musical address as follows: Our D is a major second above the tonic, C, a perfect fifth above the root, G, and a minor third above the bass, B.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In becoming conscious of one’s harmonic whereabouts, one must take care not to overemphasize the value of the root, especially at the expense of the tonic. Since you are <em class="calibre3">on</em> a root and <em class="calibre3">in</em> a key, the superficial immediacy of the <em class="calibre3">on</em> can overshadow the deeper (albeit more subtle) gravitational effect of the <em class="calibre3">in</em>. Jazz theory in particular has seriously crippled itself with what could be called root abuse: Conventionally, each new root is thought to generate a new scale, whereas in actuality modal variations generated by a single tonic are used over long harmonic periods. (This subject is discussed in detail in chapter 37.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">With practice, the gestalt of your harmonic position is just as immediately sensible to you as your location in your room on your street in your town. At any moment, the nested hierarchy of relationships to bass, root, and tonic becomes equally as intuitive—and just as intellectually retrievable—as your address. In fact, the ease with which we comprehend the nested geography of music indicates that the harmonic lattice is not merely a metaphor for musical behavior but corresponds to a spatial geography in the brain. (This subject is discussed in the afterword.)</p>
        <p class="csht1">TRIADS AS SPECIAL COLLECTIONS</p>
        <p class="ctx">Any combination of two or more tones can be called a collection. There are myriad collections of tones that are useful and beautiful, some more so than others. Certain collections are extremely stable: the major triad, for instance, and, less so, the minor triad. Diminished and augmented triads are unstable; because they serve as tonally functional triads only as weak links in chains of primarily major and minor triads, we might call them quasi-triads (as we shall discuss in the next chapter). It is valuable to understand triads in the same way one understands all collections, “triadic” or not—that is, by the lattice positions of their constituents in respect to the tonal center. To the extent that harmony is tonal, it can be revealed by one principle only: its agreements by fifths and thirds (begging the question of the seventh partial for the moment). Triads do not represent a separate magic, only a more potent version of the only magic in town. The fact that major and minor triads enclose a triangle on the lattice is an indication of the stability that the proximity of their fifths and thirds gives them. Augmented triads, however, are sections of a spine of thirds, that is, a straight line whose end points are not proximate. Diminished triads come in three different configurations, as shown in example 35.5.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="ctx">In addition to sorting out the harmonic qualities of the various conventional triads, positional analysis allows a precise perception of and comparison among the various suspended, inverted, incomplete, or “altered” triads, as well as every other conceivable collection. We can see that a seamless continuum of tonal value spans from fundamental resonances to the nether regions of tonal perception, and that triads do not necessarily determine or broker it. To be blunt: Harmonic analysis by triads and their supposed deformations, along with the scalar triadic functions that are ascribed to them (in other words, traditional harmonic analysis), is extremely limited. The triadic concept has tyrannized music theory long enough. We will reinterpret triads by defining them as particularly stable collections within a very large array of possible collections, all of which are subject to positional analysis.</p>

        <p class="csht">When to Analyze and When Not</p>
        <p class="ctx">Before leaping into an ocean of analytical models and a lifetime of practice internalizing them, let’s reaffirm that analysis is a tool—a means, not an end. It helps you when you are lost; it allows your mind to expand; it hones your ear; it can point the way. It can also <em class="calibre3">get</em> you lost and obscure what is real in music. My advice: Analyze only if you also don’t analyze. Make yourself think things through; but also learn to let yourself hear things without naming them. There comes a day when these two modes merge. Remember how long it took you to coo, then babble, then talk baby talk, then say whole sentences, then diagram sentences, then write essays and debate your friends, all leading toward that moment when, entirely focused and without any thought to language, you declared yourself to be the person you are. Musical language is the same: half thought out, half blurted out, clever mind and blind heart lurching and tumbling toward their eventual union. In certain ways, it happens by itself. But it helps to intentionally separate analytical pursuit from nameless listening, to teach yourself to enter either or both at will, to balance each against the other, so you can guide them toward their marriage.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="ctx">THE TWO MOST BASIC KINDS OF HARMONIC PRACTICE are sequences and cadences. A harmonic sequence is a series of chords, usually triads or triad-based, whose roots progress in an intervalic pattern. A harmonic cadence is a progression of chords that centers unequivocally in one key. Sequences and cadences are traditionally learned by means of models that have been abstracted especially for pedagogical purposes.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Harmonic models are generally singable by four singers, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass; but they are also intended for keyboard practice and fit easily under the hands. They are configured to optimize (1) coherent melodic motion within each individual part, (2) contrapuntal relationships among the parts, and (3) clarity in the overall harmonic progression. Coherent melody moves essentially by steps; the occasional leap is usually followed by stepwise motion in the opposite direction. Transparent counterpoint requires a maximum of contrary motion, no parallel octaves or fifths between any two parts, and the fewest possible leaps to or from dissonance. Clarity in the harmony is usually enhanced by placing the most compelling melodic part in the soprano.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">The sequences and cadences presented in part 4 are like organic molecules that combine in elaborate ways to bring tonal harmony to life. The purpose in learning them is to have automatically at your disposal every harmonic move in every key. The entire compass of available triadic harmony in twelve-tone equal temperament can be accounted for by a surprisingly small number of basic models—three dozen, plus or minus a dozen, depending on your level of detail. Although the basic moves are few, it does take a while to internalize each model’s highly concentrated stream of information into the muscles of your hands, and into your ear and brain. After a certain period of time, the information is simply there, exactly like a fluent language, instantly available for retrieval, elaboration, and taking apart and putting back together. Over time, the ardors and agonies of learning fall away and are forgotten; even the necessity of a keyboard falls away. Then harmony belongs to you.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Does anybody ever actually do this?</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Yes, with decreasing frequency. One hundred years ago, educated musicians in Europe were expected to have these skills, or some version of them, and to demonstrate them improvisationally at the keyboard. But as that era of concert music recedes from view, so do its ideals and its pedagogy. In the United States, as one travels west (away from Europe) one encounters fewer and fewer people who know tonal harmony well. However, whenever and wherever you live, if you want to learn tonal harmony in all of its manifestations, fluency in sequential and cadential models is probably the fastest and most comprehensive route.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Chapters 36 (diatonic sequences), 38 (cadences), and 41 (cyclic sequences) contain virtually all the fundamental harmonic models needed for mastery of the subject. Our study in this chapter will begin as simply as possible, using only the triads of the Major mode. Then seventh chords will be considered, as well as other modes.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Harmonic sequences can be classified according to the intervalic motion of their roots. Three categories (and their inversions) account for all the intervals: thirds (or sixths), fifths (or fourths), and seconds (or sevenths). Each classification has its characteristic part motion, as we shall see.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-270" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Descending Root Motion by Thirds</p>
        <p class="ctx">Example 36.1 shows a series of chords in root position; the roots descend diatonically by thirds. Notice that the soprano (stems up) and the alto (stems down) are written in the upper staff, and the tenor (stems up) and the bass (stems down) are in the lower staff—a convention we will observe whenever practical. In this example, play the upper three parts with the right hand.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice that in the upper three parts, only one part moves at a time: first the alto (G to A), then the tenor (E to F), then the soprano (C to D), then the alto again, and so on. Each part ascends stepwise in contrary motion to the bass, and each tone of each part lasts three beats, once the pattern gets going. Notice also that if you were singing soprano, on the first beat you would be singing the root, on the next beat the third, and on the next the fifth, continuing successively root, third, fifth, and so on. Sequences with such a threefold pattern can be called <em class="calibre3">tricyclic.</em> To demonstrate the tricyclic nature of this sequence even more clearly, play example 36.2; notice that at every third chord the bass leaps up a sixth (instead of down a third). Compared with the preceding example, this sequence can be continued for many more bars (try it) before running out of keyboard.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">An interesting and useful musical effect results from arranging the bass so the upward leap of a sixth occurs after every four chords instead of after every three, which gives a duple cast to the threefold nature, as in example 36.3.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The challenge is to continue the sequence after the written music stops. If you have trouble doing so, play the parts individually; the sequential order of each melody reveals itself instantly; you will then hear better how to proceed in four simultaneous parts. The models should be practiced until they are legato and effortless, that is, until their harmonic quality can be clearly sensed.</p>

        <p class="csht">Distribution of the Comma</p>
        <p class="ctx">If example 36.1 were in just intonation and each chord were harmonically continuous to the next (in proper “matchstick” fashion), then each reiteration of the tonic triad would be a Didymic comma lower than the preceding one, and, traveling ever westward on the harmonic lattice, one would eventually end up in subsonic territory. To picture how the progression would begin, follow the arrows of the chord lattice in figure 36.1 (which is in staff orientation).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The progression would then continue as shown by the arrows in figure 36.2, arriving at the next tonic, pitched a Didymic comma lower. But a cappella singers would not let that occur; they most likely would adjust their tuning at the diminished chord, intuitively singing the 15:8 B and raising the D substantially—probably more than half the comma—enabling them to tune the succeeding G chord by raising it the rest of the way. Example 36.5 is what the singers’ B diminished chord looks like on the lattice of tones. (It is a combination of <em class="calibre3">a</em> and <em class="calibre3">b</em> in example 35.5.)</p>

        <p class="ctx">Since the G triad is the last chance to tune, it is safe to say that the comma would be distributed over at least those two chords, probably not much earlier and definitely not later. The singers’ overall map would look like figure 36.3.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">What happens in equal temperament? My<b class="calibre8"> </b>sense is that the temperament does not alter the 
essential quality of the sequence. In equal temperament, the D-minor chord is first heard as the subdominant-oriented version based on the 10:9 <em class="calibre3">re</em>. Again the diminished chord provides an escape hatch: When it sounds, the D becomes ambiguous; at the sounding of the G chord, the ear recognizes the D as the 9:8 <em class="calibre3">re,</em> and the return to the real tonic is assured. Pathfinder has had a nice ride, and Homebody serves the usual tea.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">So in equal temperament the comma is still distributed over two chords, perhaps with a slightly different feeling of twist or pull than in just intonation, but with the same overall effect, that is, of traveling continuously southwest and repeatedly rematerializing in the northeast. The melodic continuity in the upper parts, the tricyclic pattern of the voicing, and the reciprocally flowing harmony, all combine to smooth out the inevitable discontinuity between ii and V; so much so, in fact, that the entire stream of chords seems almost seamless. Almost, but not quite. There’s still something peculiar about that diminished chord beyond its innate sound. I think it is the very fact that it is not a full-fledged triad but a quasi-triadic, motley collection of tones that allows it to carry the tuning adjustment in just intonation, as well as the change in our sense of location in equal temperament. It is the less stable, more flexible construction that absorbs the comma—a fascinating example of a chain’s weakest link evolving into a crucial function. The diminished chord is a weak triad but a talented carrier of ambiguity.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The sequence of descending fifths is similar to that of descending thirds in that it is tricyclic, and also in that the upper parts rise by steps contrary to the bass. The difference is seen in the uneven rhythm of the individual parts: Once the pattern is underway, each part sings a half note followed by a whole note. Also, on every beat, two parts move in parallel motion (at the interval of either a third or a sixth) and one part holds. For example, from the G chord in bar 1 to the C chord, the soprano and tenor ascend stepwise in parallel sixths, while the alto holds. In the next move, the alto and tenor ascend stepwise in parallel thirds while the soprano holds, and so on.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A much smoother version of the bass would leap after every other note, producing the bicyclic arrangement shown in example 36.7.</p>

        <p class="ctx">This version is the conventional reference for diatonically descending fifths and the one to practice. Indeed, it sounds so familiar to our ears that it is easy to overlook the enormous trick inside it.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The trick is that a melodic discontinuity has been built into the part motion. From the first chord to the second is melodically continuous, as before, but from the second chord to the third, both the soprano and the tenor leap. In the continuous version (example 36.6) the F chord is a position higher, and indeed, all the parts thereafter continue to ascend. But in example 36.8 the F chord has lost elevation; it is a position lower, and the stepwise bonding has been infiltrated with small leaps. But an extraordinary new potential has come into play thanks to this manipulation, as we shall see (beginning with <a href="#calibre_link-276">example 36.17</a>).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What about the distribution of the Didymic comma in this sequence? I think that the F chord progresses directly to the version of the B diminished chord shown in example 35.5b—that is, with the 9:8 <em class="calibre3">re</em>—so the comma does <em class="calibre3">not</em> come into play at that point. The comma does occur between ii and V, the classic case described in chapter 21. So there is only one comma event every seven-chord cycle, but there are <em class="calibre3">two</em> downward sweeps: The trout leaps upstream from F to B diminished without incurring a comma, and from D minor to G by means of the comma. (Compare this with what happens when the roots descend by thirds: There is a single upward leap of recovery, as shown in figure 36.3.) Notice that even though the intervalic and melodic aspects of the sequence can be described in terms of an unbroken pattern of intervals, harmonically the pattern is rich and various, each cycle of seven chords containing two different kinds of upward-leaping discontinuities and two downward sweeps. Figure 36.4 attempts to show this graphically. The interrupted line shows the involvement of the Didymic comma.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Figure 36.5 shows the path without the chord names. This is a good time to point out that by virtue of its bicyclic configuration, the sequence of example 36.8, although it contains seven different chords, takes fifteen chords to come around to its starting position. Notice how, at the eighth chord, you are on the chord where you began, but not in the distribution in which you began. By the fifteenth chord you are back to the same chord <em class="calibre3">and</em> the same distribution.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This sequence of diatonic descending fifths is probably the most-used and useful one in tonal harmony. Before examining its many elaborations, let’s pause to consider various ways of practicing sequences in general.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-274" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Internalizing the Wisdom of Harmonic Sequences</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is one thing to recognize the wealth of information stored up in a sequence and quite another to be able to use that wealth as your own. The following practice regimen transforms harmonic models in general from rigid exercises into living language.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">1. <em class="calibre3">Learn the model</em>. When you first look at a harmonic model, play each part individually through at least one complete cycle, starting with the bass, then the soprano, then the tenor, then the alto. Then listen to the relationships between every pair: bass and soprano (outer parts), bass and tenor (lower parts), tenor and alto (inner parts), and alto and soprano (upper parts). It is also good practice to sing each part while playing one or two or three others.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Next, play all four parts at once, articulating each chord separately, that is, with no tied notes. Then, as soon as you are clear about the notes, tie all common tones, as notated in the models given here. This generates the greatest possible rhythmic diversity between the parts and clarifies the harmony. Since it is difficult to keep track of the motion of three parts played in one hand, whenever possible play two parts in the right hand and two in the left. This provides a balanced stereo effect in the body and brain, and it allows the part motion to be better felt as well as better heard. The models so far presented require three parts to be played in the right hand because of the great separation between bass and tenor. Example 36.8, however, benefits from its own special hand distribution, shown in example 36.9.</p>
        <p class="img">
          <img src="000687.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/>

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">The tenor part thus alternates between the two thumbs. This may seem like a tidy bit of trouble to go to, but remember that the point of these models is to appreciate the linear/harmonic mix that drives European tonal harmony. It is difficult at best—next to impossible is more like it—to hear four simultaneous melodies as clearly as if you were singing them, so any advantage that helps track the linear aspect is worth the effort.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Use any fingering that increases the legato; once the optimal fingering is smooth as possible, add pedal where needed. The effect should be just as if the chords appeared in an actual passage of graceful, transparent music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It helps enormously to hear the models actually sung in tune by four singers. Another option is to sing two parts with a friend and play the other two parts. Each part will then naturally achieve its proper rhythm and legato, and the extraordinary power that results when melody and harmony are optimally balanced leaps forward. Your work is to find and keep that balance at the keyboard.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">2. <em class="calibre3">Arpeggiate the model</em>. The next step is to arpeggiate the model, first upward from bass to soprano, as shown in example 36.10.</p>

example 36.11.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">3. <em class="calibre3">Ornament the model</em>. The next step is to ornament the model part by part with uncomplicated melodic and rhythmic figures. Example 36.12 shows the sequence with only the soprano ornamented.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">4. <em class="calibre3">Expand the model</em>. The next step moves the notes out from directly under the hands into the full orchestral range. This is a crucial abstraction, since the model, instead of being a tether, is now a reference. The idea is to learn the model so well that it is harmonically, melodically, visually, and conceptually available to you even in the act of transforming it. Example 36.15 is a modest expansion.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">5. <em class="calibre3">Improvise on the model</em>. There will come a point when you can further extend your techniques of elaboration and improvise freely on the model, using whatever you need to make music any way you hear it. This is the true use of harmonic models: They serve as both the touchstone and the departure point for your own musical explorations. They will also, incidentally, render transparent to you the music of classical composers and their progeny.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">6. <em class="calibre3">Transpose</em>. It is my duty to keep reminding you that there are twelve keys, and that developing equal—or even decent—facility in all of them is the most time-consuming part of learning tonal harmony. But this is exactly what makes the models so valuable: They are the most efficient way of gaining fluency in keys. If you are comfortable improvising on a model in C, and you learn the model really well in D<span class="fon">b</span>, you are on your way to comfort in D<span class="fon">b</span>. So the time you spend learning harmonic models is saved many times over during the lifelong working out of your musical values.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now back to more sequences.</p>

<p class="ctx">The sequence in example 36.17 is like example 36.8, but the nonmelodic leaps in the bass have been replaced by steps and thirds through the convention of making every other chord a first-inversion chord. The symbol for a chord in first inversion is <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">6</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span>;</span> 3 alone indicates a chord in root position.</p><p class="img"><img src="000695.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 36.17</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">The only difference from example 36.8 is the <em class="calibre3">arrangement</em> of tones. Notice that the old alto of example 36.8 is the new tenor of example 36.17; the old soprano is the new bass; the old bass is distributed alternately between the new soprano and the new alto; and the old tenor likewise between the new alto and the new soprano. The seamless melodicism of this arrangement is almost dangerous: Everything is so smooth that one tends to forget that the real power still lies in the Pythagorean bonding of the roots. It is a harmonic sequence with a felicitous melodic aspect, not the other way around. This is a crucial point. It is still the “agreement” among the tones that is calling the shots in this game; their intervalic proximity simply smooths out the harmonic path. (If you don’t believe me, play the left hand as written while playing the right hand a half-step higher than written.)</p><p class="calibre5">The harmony demonstrated in example 36.17 is ubiquitous in the culture, yet we never tire of it. Many profitable hours can be spent learning to improvise on it in all twelve keys. But it can be extended further.

      <div id="calibre_link-277" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Nomenclature of Seventh Chords</p>
        <p class="ctx">First let me point out that cardinal numbers (like <sup class="calibre11">7</sup>) mean one thing in Roman numeral notation and another in letter name notation. Roman numeral notation is diatonic; that is, it is based on the prevailing key signature. Thus the <sup class="calibre11">7</sup> in I<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> means, “Add the seventh degree above the tonic, whatever note that happens to be according to the key signature.” The Roman numeral system is used primarily to show <em class="calibre3">function;</em> the numeral I means, “This chord functions as the tonic chord.” To actually play the chord you have to know what key and what mode you are in. Letter name notation, however, is note-specific. C<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> refers to the notes C–E–G–B<span class="fon">b</span>, regardless of context, but it does not tell you the function of the chord.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The difficulty with letter name notation is its inconsistency. There is a kind of subterranean method in its madness, however, which we will try to fathom. Let’s begin with the letters themselves.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">An uppercase letter standing alone (C) indicates a <em class="calibre3">major</em> triad; it says, “The interval of the third above this root is major.” In other words, <em class="calibre3">the major-ness of the third is understood.</em></p>
        <p class="calibre5">If you want the third to be minor, however, you have to say so: Cm or Cmi or Cmin are the accepted symbols. It is best to avoid C<sup class="calibre11">−</sup> because the dash is conventionally reserved for diminished intervals. The lowercase cmi can be graphically useful sometimes, as on the lattice maps. A lowercase letter standing alone (c) invites confusion into an already confused realm; it should never be used. The publishing convention is to use uppercase letters only.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now for the numbers: <sup class="calibre11">7</sup> standing without a modifier means, “The interval of the seventh above the root is <em class="calibre3">minor</em>.” In other words, <em class="calibre3">the minor-ness of the seventh is understood</em>; hence, example 36.20. The point: An unmodified letter, a naked <em class="calibre3">C</em>, indicates a <em class="calibre3">major</em> third, but a naked <sup class="calibre11">7</sup> refers to a <em class="calibre3">minor</em> seventh.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Now what about Cmi<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>? Remembering that the modifier <em class="calibre3">mi</em> is reserved for the third and that the minor-ness of the seventh is understood, picture the symbol Cmi<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> as in example 36.21.</p>

Remembering that the modifier MAJ is reserved for the seventh and that the major-ness of the third is understood, picture the symbol CMA<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> as in example 36.22.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 36.23 shows all four possibilities. It is prudent, especially in speech, to make a clear verbal distinction between the names of intervals and the names of chords. “The interval of the minor seventh above C” means the note B<span class="fon">b</span>; “the chord C minor seven” means C–E<span class="fon">b</span>–G–B<span class="fon">b</span>. “Add the seventh to C” and “play the minor seventh of C” are both unclear.</p>

It is a B diminished triad with the interval of a minor seventh (A) added above the root. This type of chord has many names, some of them conflicting. The time to deal fully with the nomenclature of seventh chords based on diminished triads has finally—as promised in chapter 31—arrived.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">First, for reference, example 36.24 gives the names for the various intervals of the seventh above the tone B.</p>

        <p class="ctx">The symbol for a diminished triad is <em class="calibre3">dim,</em> or sometimes ° or, in Roman numeral notation, a slash through the numeral.

The name for our chord in question, that is, example 36.26, most correctly should be Bdim<sup class="calibre11">(mi 7)</sup>, which means, “a B diminished triad with the addition of a minor seventh above the root,” but the common name has become Bmi7<sup class="calibre11">(-5)</sup>, which means, “a triad whose third is minor, seventh is minor, and fifth is diminished,” or less accurately but more popularly, Bmi<sup class="calibre11">7(</sup><span class="fon">b</span><sup class="calibre11">5)</sup>, “B minor seven flat five.”</p>

My preference, in the name of accuracy, is either of the longer symbols: Bmi<sup class="calibre11">7(-5)</sup> or Bmi<sup class="calibre11">7(</sup><span class="fon">b</span><sup class="calibre11">5)</sup>. Also, since the chord so frequently occurs on the leading tone of the Major mode, it is often called a “leading-tone seventh chord.” But if you discover these same intervals built up from some other degree (it is the supertonic seventh of Aeolian, for instance), it is better to use the term <em class="calibre3">leading-tone-seventh-type</em> chord.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Harmonic Qualities of Seventh Chords</p>
        <p class="ctx">Each kind of seventh chord has its own characteristic quality just as surely as does each kind of triad. The musical work is to learn to recognize the particular mixture of resonances that each kind of seventh chord offers. Then sequences of such chords become even more alive to the ear.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are four kinds of seventh chords in the major mode, as can be observed by reviewing example 36.19.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">1. The I<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> and IV<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> are both major seventh chords: major triads with the addition of the interval of the major seventh above the root. Consulting the lattice, one sees that the tones of each chord enclose two triangles representing a major triad (on the left) and a minor triad (on the right), as shown in figure 36.6.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">2. The ii<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>, iii<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>, and vi<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> are all minor seventh chords: minor triads with the addition of the interval of the minor seventh above the root. On the lattice, the Ami<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> and the Emi<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> enclose two triangles representing a minor triad (on the left) and a major triad (on the right); the more reciprocal version of the Dmi<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> 
has the same configuration, as shown in figure 36.7. There are other configurations of the ii chord, depending on how the comma is heard.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">3. The V<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> is the dominant seventh chord: a major triad with the addition of the interval of the minor seventh above the root. We have discussed the harmonic properties of this chord in chapter 32 and shown its map: a triad with a subdominant spur. It is the “dominant” seventh, of course, because its root is the fifth degree of the scale, but people often use “dominant seventh” to refer to any chord built up from these intervals regardless of its function. This particular type of confusion (which we have already encountered in the case of the leading-tone seventh) arises in two ways. First, a chord with the same intervalic construction as the “dominant seventh chord” can occur on degrees other than the dominant (G–B–D–F, for instance, is the subdominant seventh of D Dorian, or the supertonic seventh of F Lydian). Second, in modes other than major, the actual dominant seventh chord—the one based on the fifth degree—is more often than not some other kind of chord (in D Dorian, for instance, it is A–C–E–G, an Ami<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>.) To stave off dementia, the best term for major triads with the added interval of the minor seventh that do <em class="calibre3">not</em> have a dominant function is <em class="calibre3">dominant-seventh-type</em> chord.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">4. The vii<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> is a minor seventh with a diminished fifth. An examination of the lattice shows a large number of possible configurations for this chord; since it often functions as a shunt for the Didymic comma, all of the possibilities might come into play at one time or another. As example 36.27 shows, each tone has a Didymic stepsibling on the other side of C.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now, after having considered the harmonic properties of these complex and intriguing chords, play example 36.18 again. At first, linger on each chord, delving into its nature. Notice especially how the seventh of each seventh chord leads down a step to the third of the following triad, and track that motion through each flavor of seventh chord through each degree. Then draw back a little and glide through example 36.18 effortlessly. How could all that complication add up to such a felicitous little slice of musical life? Could it be that <em class="calibre3">we</em> are a little bit complicated?</p>

This sequence is remarkable in that each part is now descending by steps. We have traced, one by one, the transformations that have culminated in this result, but it is amazing nonetheless to realize that (with no change in the root pattern) what began as upward stepwise motion in the top three parts (example 36.6) is now downward stepwise motion in all the parts. Notice also, as you play through the sequence, that the inversions swap after the first cycle of seven chords and come around again after fourteen chords.</p><p class="calibre5">An even more familiar version can be seen if we reconfigure the parts to alternate between second inversion and root position and close up the voicing.

All of the modes of the same intervalic type as Major (i.e., Lydian through Phrygian—see chapter 23) will devolve into sounding like Major, owing to its unique harmonic stability. Also, modes containing augmented seconds do not sequence very smoothly. But some other modes are fruitful. We have already mentioned the rich variety of seventh chords that can arise from certain modes (see chapter 24). Follow the seventh chords of MA/MI, for instance, as they spiral through a sequence of descending fifths, as in example 36.32. The

        <p class="calibre5">Notice what happens in bar 1 as the G chord moves to Ami: The three upper parts all move in the same direction (down), which is contrary to the bass (which moves up).

        <p class="calibre5">Within the contrapuntal aesthetic, however, such motion, which involves parallel octaves and parallel fifths, is always avoided; the four independent voices collapse into one thick melody. Small melodic leaps in motion contrary to the bass (such as in example 36.34) are not difficult to hear; with their aid, maximum transparency between the parts is assured.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">You may recognize the first few chords of this sequence as the harmonic substrate for much music, including the Pachelbel Canon in D, wherein the basic progression is as shown in example 36.36.</p>

        <p class="ctx">The sequences shown in this chapter are a fair representation of the possible combinations of diatonic triads in C. The idea isn’t to memorize every possible move, but to use representative models to train your ears and fingers to hear naturally the special mix of polyphony and harmony that is the European legacy. The hardest part of the subject is the transposition into the eleven other keys. It is next to impossible (unless you are musically innocent through and through) to have equal facility in all keys—or at least, I’ve never met anyone who has. Even Mozart and Bach had better and worse keys. Why? Because we are trapped by the notation, by the keyboard, and by our history. D is the center of the notation (see chapter 11), and as long as our ears are skewed toward the major mode, C remains the fundamental reference of the keyboard. Yet it is also true that the more you practice in keys, the more overall harmonic facility you gain, and these harmonic models, apart from their innate beauty and fascination, are a most efficient means to that end.</p>

      <p class="ctx">THE HARMONIC CADENCE is a centering device. It focuses the ear on a specific tone on the lattice and says, “This is your home (for now).” Although cadences have important melodic and rhythmic dimensions, our primary concern here is with harmony. In chapter 20 we presented the ping-pong cadence and the whole cadence as types of wave energy that oscillate in the <em class="calibre3">pa</em> dimension (east-west on the lattice) centered on C. “Polar flips in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> dimension” were shown to be the pentamerous analogue of the “whole” cadence. We went on to compose long, looping triadic journeys based on these two dimensions of motion oscillating around C. The particular mechanisms by which harmonic cadences concentrate and center their energy will be the subject of chapters 37 and 38.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Our chief concentration in chapter 37 will be the modal strategies that contribute to cadential power: in other words, the dynamics of pentamerous cadential energy. We will confine ourselves to relatively simple cadences, that is, forms of the whole cadence (IV–V–I), and will focus primarily on the scales that arise from various modal combinations.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="ctx">In this deliberately simple passage, the pertinent question is, What is the tonality of the scales in bar 2? The answer is that the passage not only centers on C Major but also sounds as though it is in C Major all the way through. The scales in bar 2 are C Major scales repositioned in the ear onto other degrees. Specifically, the F chord is not heard as a change of tonal center, nor is the G chord. Those chords are perched respectively on the fourth and fifth degrees of C, and the C Major scale, first heard in the treble of bar 1 as ascending an octave starting from C, in bar 2 is heard again, this time ascending an octave starting from F, then again descending an octave from G, and finally, in bar 3, descending from C.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The reason for going on at length about such an obvious example is that common wisdom—especially the common wisdom of jazz theory, a primary reference for most improvisors—states the case differently. According to the prevailing teaching, a new scale is generated from the root of each new chord. Accordingly, the scale against the C chord is C Major; the scale against the F chord is F Lydian; and the scale against the G chord is G Mixolydian. The notes are the same according to either naming system, of course, but the false names, seemingly harmless in this simple case, will quickly lead us into the familiar quicksand of a failed nomenclature.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To be true, a name needs to reflect true feelings. The distinction here is whether, at the F chord in bar 2, we feel <em class="calibre3">on</em> or <em class="calibre3">in</em> F. The reason <em class="calibre3">on</em> wins over <em class="calibre3">in</em> is context. The context in this case is a harmonically balanced cadence; we feel the ping-pong of Pythagorean energy. If the same progression were stretched out over ten minutes—five <em class="calibre3">seconds</em> for the first chord, five <em class="calibre3">minutes</em> for the F chord, five <em class="calibre3">minutes</em> for the G chord—the Pythagorean energy would be marginalized and we would develop a sense of modal modulation. But in the cadential context given here, there is no Lydian or Mixolydian feeling. We zip through aspects of C Major, <em class="calibre3">on</em> the roots, but not <em class="calibre3">in</em> their keys. Check this out for yourself as you play the passage. Do you stay in the key of C or do you move to other keys and modes? (You may want to review chapter 11 for the nature of Lydian and Mixolydian modes in dronality.) The remarkable thing is how, among musicians, there never seems to be disagreement about the feeling—all who hear it agree that the passage never leaves the key of C. It is the concept that is problematic—the conceptual distinction between <em class="calibre3">on</em> and <em class="calibre3">in</em>—and it is a crucial one for understanding harmony.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Rule: <em class="calibre3">Name scales from the tonic, not the root.</em> Name tonal events from the tonal center—what you are <em class="calibre3">in</em>. Tonics generate the prevailing feeling and meaning of the music. Do not name scales from the triadic roots—what you are <em class="calibre3">on</em>. Roots are colorful and useful, but their organizational function is not as strong as tonics. Chords generally cluster together in groups organized by one tonic, especially at cadences, although also, as we have seen, in sequences and in less-patterned progressions. Tonics change much less frequently than roots. Their pull is stronger, their organization higher, and their requirements not only more compelling but more generous. Roots are sprites. Tonics are gods.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If we name from the roots in example 37.1, we will have three keys generating three modes. If we name from the tonic, we have one key and one mode viewed from three positions. The ear repositions tonal material easily and immediately; it changes tonics much less readily. As our examples increase in complexity, the wisdom of naming from the tonic, and the conceptual purgatory resulting from naming from the root, will emerge. Avoid root abuse.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Here is the full rule: <em class="calibre3">Name tonal material from the tonic you are in, as perceived from the root you are on.</em> The first scale of bar 2 is then “a C Major scale perceived from F”; the second is “a C Major scale perceived from—or <em class="calibre3">standing on</em>—G.” “Standing on” is a good convention. It is like seeing the same house from different rooms.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Next, let’s change the cadential model slightly. The F-major triad will now be its neighbor, a first-inversion D-minor triad, as shown in example 37.2.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Now the tonal center is even more clearly C. The question is, How is the tonal material over the D diminished triad (in the first half of bar 2) to be named? If it were some sort of D mode, it would look like example 37.4 and we would name it “D Locrian-Mixolydian over Phrygian,” or “D Locrian major 6.”</p>

        <p class="calibre5">But the key is actually C and the mode is Harmonic Minor and we are hearing it from D (which is the root, even though the bass is F). Notice that Harmonic Minor is a mixed mode in the sense that E<span class="fon">b</span> and A<span class="fon">b</span> are reciprocal thirds (contained in C Minor) and B<span class="fon">n</span> is an overtonal third (contained in C Major). In such cases of modal mixing, the ability of the ear to perceive the entire cadential passage in terms of the tonic is especially clear.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-289" class="calibre1"><p class="csht">Borrowing from Minor</p><p class="ctx">Once it is understood that the ear recognizes tonal content in respect to the tonal center, it becomes possible to track modal changes that occur within a cadential phrase. Example 37.5 is in the key of C, but the mode undergoes change.</p><p class="img"><img src="000727.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 37.5</em></b></p><p class="ctx">The first two and a half beats spin out the notes of C Major, but the reciprocal A<span class="fon">b</span> and E<span class="fon">b</span> (from C Minor) appear during the V harmony. Major is then restored in bar 2. The use of such reciprocal material in an otherwise major cadence is called <em class="calibre3">borrowing from Minor</em>.</p><p class="calibre5">Musical cadences can be considered miniature dramatic stories replete with a thickening of the plot (the chords preceding the dominant chord), a climax (the dominant chord) and a denouement (the resolution to the tonic). It is the release of resolution that we all want, the return to the hearth, the satisfaction of the Homebody instinct after the adventures of Pathfinder have spun themselves out. Precisely as in literal storytelling, the moment of return in music is the moment of emotional catharsis, the promise of which has led us forward. The gradual infusion of reciprocal <em class="calibre3">ga</em> material serves as a thickening of the plot; typically this continues until the moment of the final tonic major chord, which suddenly flips us back to the release of overtonal stability. Borrowing from Minor—the reversal of polarity in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> dimension—can thus be understood as a heightening of the dramatic tension.</p><p class="calibre5">Often the borrowing is even more extreme, that is, more reciprocal. Example 37.6 uses the minor second degree of C, D<span class="fon">b</span>, in a construction common in classical music, the so-called Neapolitan sixth.</p><p class="img"><img src="000728.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 37.6</em></b></p>

The translation to the visual metaphor of the five-limit lattice of twelve notes is particularly revealing here. The “dramatic moment” uses all four reciprocal thirds; the “catharsis” uses all four overtonal thirds. We are flipped from yin to yang, neat as a pin. And look what happens when you combine all of the tones of the jazz cadence into one scale: It is none other than the Magic Scale of chapter 25, shown again in example 37.10.</p><p class="img"><img src="000732.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 37.10</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">The end of the first Magic Mode piece (example 25.41, bars 16–18) is another example of the Phrygian-to-Lydian flip (see also the end of <a href="#calibre_link-461">example 26.43</a>). Try composing or improvising your own examples of such cadences in C, and in other keys as well.</p><p class="calibre5">Now, for a moment, glance again at example 37.1. When you hear cadential material in a form that is melodically scalar and harmonically stable, the changing of roots in the chord progression does not obscure the clarity of the tonal center; all of the material is an obviously single mode of a single key. But when the mode begins to move through its various overtonal and reciprocal forms, it takes some discernment to recognize that modal borrowing does not constitute a change of tonic, that even though the roots move and the mode changes, the tonal center holds. This is more than a fine point; it is at the heart of cadential harmony and our response to it.</p><p class="calibre5">Consider how, in dronal music, one’s entire emotional cast can swing around at a single pentamerous reversal. In tonal harmony (equal-tempered or not) cadential passages are just as key-centered, just as fixed on the tonic, as in dronality, except that the drone is not sounding. In place of the drone is the rich context afforded by triads and other, more dense collections of tones. The rainbow of feeling, the height and breadth provided by the ancient modal system, is never so clearly present in modern music as it is in cadences that explore the modal palette of the target key. Such cadences provide the same ride from sunny to moony and back again that we dronal singers experienced in chapter 11, and the mechanism that determines the mood is the same: the polarity of the thirds.</p></div>

        <p class="calibre5">The scale is thought to be intervalically attractive (about which more in a moment) as well as tonally rich. Its strange name persists because its true derivation has not been understood. In our view, tonal material should be identified in terms of the target tonic. Accordingly, the tones of the altered scale are described as follows: A<span class="fon">b</span>, E<span class="fon">b</span>, B<span class="fon">b</span>, and D<span class="fon">b</span> are borrowed from C Phrygian; B remains from C Major. The note C, although it <em class="calibre3">could</em> be included in the scale, is typically omitted for the same reason that the tonic is usually absent from any dominant-functioning harmony: One avoids the punch line during the setup of a joke. The tonic is the punch line, and it is best reserved for the end. The altered scale is then redefined as a C Phrygian scale, perceived from G, with two forms of seventh (B<span class="fon">b</span> and B<span class="fon">n</span>) and the tonic unspoken. In other words, it is an especially sonorous form of borrowing from Phrygian.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The same scale, perceived from D<span class="fon">b</span>, is sometimes misidentified as a D<span class="fon">b</span> “Lydian Dominant” scale. Example 37.14, referred to in jazz as “the 
<span class="fon">b</span>II substitution,” is in fact the very same borrowing from Phrygian—one might say the “Phrygianization”—of C.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now, about the allure of the intervals. The so-called altered scale is intervalically attractive because it contains the whole tone–half tone pattern of a “diminished scale,” as well as five out of the six possible tones of a whole-tone scale (shown in example 37.15).</p>

      <p class="ctx">For the moment, we will let this model stand for all cadences in general and use it to help us define some important terms. We will use the term <em class="calibre3">ultimate chord</em> (U) to define the closing tonic chord of a cadence. The chord immediately preceding the ultimate chord can then be called the <em class="calibre3">penultimate chord</em> (PU); it is almost always based on the dominant triad, although there are some exceptions. The chord directly preceding the penultimate chord in example 38.1 we will consider a kind of deformation of it, a double suspension (which will be discussed in detail momentarily); we will call it the <em class="calibre3">suspended penultimate chord</em> (sus.PU). The chord before <em class="calibre3">that</em> we will call the <em class="calibre3">pre-penultimate</em> chord (PPU).</p>
      <p class="calibre5">By definition, the chords in cadences are arranged to have greater and greater specificity for the tonic, by which I mean that the closer the chord is to the tonic, the more the tonic attracts it, much like metal objects around a magnet, or like meteorites as they approach Earth. By the time the cadence has reached the penultimate chord, the pull of the tonic is so great that there is only one possible outcome, and the cadence resolves. Although there are an indefinitely large number of variations of the basic cadential model, there is only one basic dynamic, which can be seen on the lattice as an inevitable contraction toward a central tone. Example 38.2 presents an overview of that dynamic using conventional notation.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Long Cadence: General Characteristics</p>
        <p class="ctx">Example 38.2, which we will call the Long Cadence, categorizes and presents in temporal order most of the triadic functions in the variously configured cadences of tonal harmony. Before discussing these chords individually, here are some general remarks about the Long Cadence.</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">The Phrygian penultimate.</em> Notice first that the Phrygian-based chords (in the first bar) are understood to resolve directly to the tonic chord, which, in the Phrygian cadence, is usually either major or the “open” dyad C–G. These chords can be called <em class="calibre3">Phrygian penultimate chords</em> (Ph.PU); they are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">General motion.</em> The Long Cadence can be read, generally, left to right. No PPU chords, or one PPU chord only, or several PPU chords may be used; if more than one, they typically appear left to right. Notice how the overall progression of PPU chords is roughly from moony to sunny, that is, reciprocal to overtonal, although cadences are pliable constructions and there are many specific exceptions (including borrowing; see chapter 37). The sus.PU is optional; its use is most characteristic of the century between 1750 to 1850 and evokes identification with that period.</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">The Cadence as a special case of the Magic Mode</em>. If all the equal-tempered tones in the Long Cadence were placed within an octave, they would constitute (once again) none other than the twelve-note Magic scale, with its five chromatic pairs and fixed tonic and dominant. We have seen this same scale in just intonation (examples 11.2 and 15.22), in equal-tempered dronality (example 25.39), and as a scalar reduction of the jazz cadence (chapter 37). Now it is appearing in example 38.2 as the scalar template of tonal cadences.</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">The Long Cadence on the lattice.</em> The notes of the equal-tempered Long Cadence (like the notes of the Magic Mode), when represented on the five-limit lattice, are seen to form a large harmonic field surrounding the tonic. (“Large” because the field contains several Didymic pairs and is thus not limited to twelve lattice positions.) The purpose of a cadence is to center the ear on one tone, and every motion that occurs within a cadence can be felt as a dramatic event that either hastens or delays the inevitable climax and resolution. Harmonically speaking, a cadence is like a special kind of board game. The board is the lattice, the players are the voices, and every player’s objective is to land gracefully and convincingly in the center of the chosen area of play, which is the tonic. Each player approaches or retreats according to his or her particular position and logic while keeping in harmony with the others. The final moment of absolute convergence is also the moment of total agreement, and every player wins.</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">Melodic versus harmonic components of cadences.</em> Although this is a book about harmony, we need to bear in mind the vital linear aspect of cadential motion. For instance, in example 38.1, as the bass is cuing the harmonic motion by surrounding the tonic by a fifth below (that is, the subdominant) and a fifth above (the dominant), the soprano is melodically surrounding the tonic by steps, as shown in example 38.3.</p>

          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">In respect to Medieval music especially, cadences have traditionally been perceived in melodic terms. One can hear melodic forces unadorned by polyphony or triadic harmony in the swooping tropes of plainchant, as well as the homophonic modal melodies of the world. But there needs to be a harmonic scheme even in monody, an agreement among the tones. One need only to seriously de-tune such melodies to hear their melodic forces reduced to the songs of wolves and coyotes. The cadences of human speech—the rise and fall of it—is inherent to its meaning, but its tones are not in whole-number ratios. Harmony is the larger context within which melodic forces can be musically effective. No harmony, no human music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">On the other hand, it is entirely possible to have cadences—huge thundering orchestral cadences—with virtually zero melody. As a thought experiment, imagine hearing a giant orchestra with a frequency range that stretches seamlessly from subsonic to ultrasonic—just a smooth sheet of sound—playing the major triads C–F–G–C. There is no tune that stands out anywhere—it is a melodic Rorschach—but the tonal effect of centering occurs just the same, because the lattice, which knows no octaves, operates <em class="calibre3">even without melodic bonding</em>. Good melodies make good harmony better, and vice versa. But good harmony can exist with <em class="calibre3">no</em> melody.

This will have somewhat the effect of analyzing a mystery story starting from the resolution of the plot and working backward through its mysterious complications.</p><p class="csht1">THE ULTIMATE CHORD: THE TONIC, I/i</p><p class="ctx">The tonic chord can be either major or minor. Quite often, cadences with a high reciprocal content will end in major, as we have seen in examples of borrowing. There is, of course, a more “ultimate” harmony than a triad, namely, an octave, or even a unison. Indeed, many classical pieces, especially ones with drawn-out, convoluted final cadences, are not over until the sounding of the final tonic octave or unison.</p><p class="csht1">THE PENULTIMATE CHORD: THE DOMINANT, V</p><p class="ctx">We have discussed the added interval of the minor seventh above the root of the dominant triad—the F of a G<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>—in chapter 32: It is 4:3 with C and tends harmonically to center the V onto the I, as well as melodically to fall stepwise to the third of the tonic chord. Although it increases the drama, the seventh is not a necessary addition to the V chord. Without it, the cadence sounds more pure, more innocent somehow, and no less compelling in its transparency. (See the cadential examples in chapter 20.)</p><p class="calibre5">For all we have experienced in this study, and for all we and others have said about the resolving power of the dominant triad, when I hear it without thinking about it, and respond to it simply, there remains mystery at the heart of it. I get it and I don’t get it. Maybe this mystery is the actual definition of tonality: the mystery of the center. Let’s leave it at that for now. More kinds of people have to get interested in the problem, more kinds of inquiries have to be made. Someday a nice young neuro-acoustician will call me and say, “Hello, is this Dr. Overtone? . . . ”</p>

<p class="ctx">The suspended penultimate chord both is and is not a tonic triad. Yes, it contains the same notes as the tonic triad, but these come at the wrong time (too soon) and in the wrong position (the dominant is in the bass) to <em class="calibre3">function</em> as a tonic triad. The chord is best thought of as a double suspension of V. The familiar 4-3 suspension of a G triad is shown in example 38.4, along with the less familiar 6-5 suspension and both suspensions taken together.</p><p class="img"><img src="000744.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><em class="calibre3"><b class="calibre8">Example 38.4</b></em></p><p class="calibre5">Each suspension by itself is an effective means of delaying the force of the V–I resolution; taken together, the delay is sufficiently dramatic to have developed, in the classical concerto, into a signal for the cadenza: an opportunity, toward the end of a movement, for extended improvisation on the part of the soloist.</p>

Its position and configuration is such that harmonic energy can proceed from reciprocal territory and cross through the tonic territory without claiming it (that is, settling in it) on its way to overtonal territory.

It is dramatic—if not theatrical—to stand on this bridge poised between the contemplative remembrance (of what has been heard) and the eager anticipation (of the resolution soon to come), and such is indeed the function of the I<span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">6</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> cadenza.</p>

There are basically two answers: Study the literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and experiment. The particular manner in which the energy of cadential resolution is heightened and obscured, promised and withheld, and finally delivered to the listener defines in large measure a classical composer’s style. With a little historical empathy and the familiarity that comes with practice, the Long Cadence will begin to appear like a full spectrum of colors laid out on a palette, waiting for the painter.</p><p class="calibre5">Example 38.9 is a brief and somewhat arbitrary compendium of commonly used cadences.

<span class="fon">b</span>VII–IV–I is known as the Mixolydian cadence (see chapter 23). Generally, subdominant cadences might be thought of as rising, instead of falling, to the tonic, and their more gentle yin quality is beguiling in that the tonic seems less fixed and the musical meaning more open and mutable. Such rising cadences are one of the open secrets of twentieth-century harmony (retold by Paul Hindemith, among many others).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The chords in parentheses have not been included in our discussion in this chapter (some do occur in parts 2 and 3) but could be used as part of Pythagorean chains that settle or rise by fifths to the tonic, providing they are played only in Pythagorean order (according to the arrows).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Even without the parenthesized chords, however, you can see that this field has more Pythagorean spines (five) than pentamerous spines (three)—it is longer than it is tall. Consequently we may well encounter Didymic pairs, which involve four perfect fifths but only one major third. (They are primarily on the pitches D and A, and perhaps B<span class="fon">b</span>; see chapters 28 and 29.) Diaschismas, which involve two major thirds, are rare (see chapter 32). Great Dieses, which involve three major thirds, do not occur. Cadences arise in music as the territory of the tonic is being enclosed, narrowed down, and finally centered onto a single tone; under these conditions the farther-flung commas will be out of bounds. Within the field, however, there is a tremendous fluidity, including reversals of right-left direction (flips in the <em class="calibre3">pa</em> realm), borrowing (flips in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> realm), and various other kinds of harmonic discontinuity, all held together by the pull of the tonic and the intention of the music to close in upon it.</p>

        <p class="csht">Overtonal/Reciprocal Balance</p>
        <p class="ctx">Although the perfect cadence (V–I) is entirely overtonal, and the minor plagal cadence (iv–i) is almost entirely reciprocal, some sort of balance between overtonal and reciprocal forces is normally an inherent factor in cadential passages. Certain chords (the French-sixth-type 
<span class="fon">b</span>II, for instance) array themselves symmetrically around the tonic, but most instances of cadential collapse toward the center are not symmetrically balanced. One reason for this is that most music, especially Western cadential music, is skewed toward the overtonal side. It is therefore quite illuminating to construct a special kind of cadence that matches overtonal and reciprocal energies tone for tone. This not only gives you a pure experience of a core harmonic force but also suggests a useful tool for further exploration.</p>

The jazz cadence given in example 37.9, an archetype of standing dissonance that covers a wide swath of harmonic territory surrounding the tonic, is only one of many commonly used standing dissonances in jazz and other contemporary music. Usually these complex chords are thought of as being built upward from a triadic foundation, as shown in example 38.24.

        <p class="csht">Tonicization versus Modulation</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is too simple to suppose that music is always in one key or another. There are many shades of certainty and uncertainty between two tonics, especially at moments of transition between them. A cleanly accomplished change of tonic is called a <em class="calibre3">modulation;</em> it usually involves an elaborated full cadence, and often indicates that the music is about to either say old things in a new way or say entirely new things. A less declamatory, more tentative move is called a <em class="calibre3">tonicization.</em> It implies a milder form of commitment than does modulation, a passing through rather than a digging in, a momentary continuation of an old idea in a fresh new key rather than a new statement or a restatement. Some tonicizations are quite fleeting—only a nod in the direction of the new key as opposed to a formal greeting. Indeed, since the nod may be almost imperceptible, there exists a cusp between tonicization and extended modality that is nebulous and subjective (though no less musical in that).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The F<span class="fon">#</span>dim<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> chord in the Long Cadence is a perfect example. Are we in a mode that mixes F<span class="fon">#</span> and E<span class="fon">b</span>, or have we tonicized G (borrowing from its minor), or both?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Consider example 38.27.</p>

        <p class="ctx">The C<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> clearly moves to F, but the drone holds the ear to C. One foot is in the key of F, the other in C.</p>

Incidentally, the C<span class="fon">#</span> makes 25:24 with C; is it also heard that way? Maybe.

Such ephemera are the fine needlepoint of cadential elaboration.

        <p class="csht">How to Practice Cadential Energy</p>
        <p class="ctx">Since tonal music involves cadential energy about half the time, the practice of cadential models is a highly efficient means of gaining both fluency at the keyboard and insight into the structure of tonal harmony. Two things make cadential practice seem daunting, however: (1) There are countless combinations of chords, especially pre-penultimate chords, and (2) there are twelve keys. The best strategy is to develop a few cadential models that cover many typical cases, and then subject each to the same routine outlined for sequences in chapter 36, namely:</p>
        <ol class="calibre6">
          <li value="1" class="calibre13">Play the parts separately, then learn all four parts super-legato, two parts in each hand (whenever possible).</li>
          <li value="2" class="calibre13">Arpeggiate the model.</li>
          <li value="3" class="calibre13">Ornament the model.</li>
          <li value="4" class="calibre13">Expand the model.</li>
          <li value="5" class="calibre13">Improvise freely on the model.</li>
          <li value="6" class="calibre13">Transpose everything.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="calibre5">For reference (as well as practice), example 38.31 shows a kind of catch-all cadential model featuring various standard moves. Example 38.32 is an elaboration.</p>

      <p class="ctx">THIS CHAPTER IS A GENERAL SURVEY of the basic mechanisms of modulation (and its milder form, tonicization) from the viewpoint of positional analysis; it includes a wide range of practices designed for maximum versatility among the twelve keys of twelve-tone equal-tempered harmony. It would be timely, before plunging ahead, to review the material on modulation that has already been presented. A general definition of modulation is given in chapter 27. The “relative” bond between pairs of triads such as C major and A minor is discussed in chapter 21. In chapter 16, in the midst of a presentation of Didymic pairs of tones, there is a relevant discussion of the Didymic comma on D that occurs when modulating from C Major pentatonic to A Minor pentatonic.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Although modulation can be accomplished by means of a sudden, unprepared, and even ambiguous leap into distant territory, what interests us here, at least initially, is the far more usual circumstance of what could be called <em class="calibre3">common-ground modulation,</em> that is, a change from one tonal center to another by means of passage through territory held mutually by both. Common territory can be a single tone, or a triad, or any other chord, or any collection, including an entire set of seven or more tones. Both tonal centers are sensible from the common ground; indeed, the listener often feels the tug of war that springs from rival allegiances.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Let’s continue our exploration of modulation with a more detailed look at a basic monophonic practice: modulation for the unaccompanied singer.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-308" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Common-Tone Modulation: The Pivot Tone</p>
        <p class="ctx">Modulations typically include many tones in common, but there is often one particular tone on which the motion between two tonal centers seems best to pivot. We will examine several cases of such pivot tones.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">First, let’s take a closer look at E as the pivot tone between the keys of C Major and A Minor. Sing example 39.1 and hear the E as being the third above the tonic C.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now sing example 39.2 and hear the E as the fifth above the tonic A. The musical context helps to establish the tonic, but there is also an internal adjustment that you, the singer, have to make. Try sustaining the E and hearing it in your head as the third above the tonic C, without sounding out the C Major example. Next, sustain the E again, but hear it as the fifth of A without sounding out the A Minor example. Now suppose a friend is listening to you, and sing the two E’s again. The two E’s that your friend hears are the same in each case, and for you (the singer) they are the same also, at least as far as pitch is concerned. But for you there is a significant difference: The context has changed in your mind, and consequently so has the function and feeling of the note. Practice sustaining the E for a full breath, while changing the meaning in your ear from the third of C Major to the fifth of A Minor, back and forth. Remember, there is no change in pitch. Become aware not only of when the gravity shifts but also of the quality of feeling that goes along with the shift. This is very subtle, inside work.</p>

The last chord the listener hears wants to resolve back to the key of C Major; for you, a new context is given to that chord even as it is struck, because you are hearing ahead. This internal hearing ahead is what allows an improvisor to construct cogent harmonic journeys. As an aspect of musical craft, this may seem a bit mysterious, but it is quite familiar in spoken language. Consider how, when improvising a bedtime story for a child, you plot sufficiently ahead to make the story both logical and surprising. The same holds true for the syntactical constructions of everyday speech—one thinks sufficiently ahead to turn phrases into sentences and sentences into paragraphs. For the improvisor (or the composer) this means sensing the target key before the listener does. You have to be ahead of the listener in the same way a mystery writer has to be ahead of the reader, or, more obviously, the way a driver’s vision is ahead of the wheels.</p><p class="calibre5">On with more pivot chords.</p><p class="calibre5">Play Cmi–A<span class="fon">b</span>–Fmi–G<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–Cmi–A<span class="fon">b</span>–B<span class="fon">b</span><sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–E<span class="fon">b</span>.</p><p class="calibre5">Now play it again but stop at the second A<span class="fon">b</span> and hear the cadence to E<span class="fon">b</span> internally.

        <p class="csht">Secondary Dominants and the Diatonic Family of Keys</p>
        <p class="ctx">All of our chord progressions so far have used perfect cadences to target their tonics. The dominant seventh chord is the strongest driver of modulation, so much so that the mere sounding of the dominant-seventh-type chord usually implies that the tonic lies a fifth below. (Proof: Walk up to a piano in any bar, play a B<span class="fon">b</span><sup class="calibre11">7</sup> arpeggio, and twenty-five people will start to sing “Over the Rainbow” in E<span class="fon">b</span>.)</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">To examine this phenomenon further, consider the set of triads shown in figure 39.1. (All chord lattices and key lattices in this chapter will be in compass orientation unless otherwise stated.) These are, of course, none other than the three major and three minor triads that arise from the key of C Major, namely, the tonic, dominant, and subdominant triads, plus their relative minors. Consider how, in the early phase of our study (part 1), the object was to become conversant with each individual tone in the key of C as a unique state of resonance with a scalar function, and how in the next phase (part 2), each tone generated a triad with a unique function in respect to the tonic. What used to be tones (C, D, E, etc.) became triads (C major, D minor, E minor, etc.). Now a new conceptual leap is made: What used to be triads are about to become keys (the key of C Major, the key of D Minor, the key of E Minor, etc.). Just as the set of <em class="calibre3">tones</em> in a major scale are a closely knit harmonic family, so is the set of <em class="calibre3">triads</em> generated by that scale, and likewise so is the set of <em class="calibre3">keys</em> whose tonics are the roots of those triads.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In figure 39.1, the chord symbols can stand also for entire keys. To clearly evoke these keys, we can precede each chord by its own dominant seventh, as shown in figure 39.2. One way to play these pairs of chords is as follows: G<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–C; A<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–Dmi; B<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–Emi; C<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–F; D<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–G; E<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–Ami.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The dominant of C is G, of course, and G<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> is called “the dominant seventh of C.” But as long as the larger context remains the key of C Major, all of these other dominant seventh chords are called <em class="calibre3">secondary dominants</em> of the key. So A<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>, B<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>, C<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>, D<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>, and E<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> are secondary dominants in the key of C Major. Example 39.8 is a compact keyboard model for learning the family of keys most closely associated with the key of C Major. Notice that in this particular model all of the dominant sevenths are in first inversion, and that the keys are arranged first in ascending and then in descending scalar order.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Each of the secondary keys is said to be tonicized by its secondary dominant; that is, the new tonics are evoked, but they are not established as firmly as they would be by using a whole cadence. This scheme of twelve chords and six keys nested within a parent key accounts for a large fraction of what happens in tonal harmony, and considerable mobility within the tonal system can be gained by mastering this model. The scalar arrangement of keys shown here is convenient, but there are more musical arrangements of the same material. Example 39.9 presents the same family of keys, but arranged as a sequence of descending thirds, starting in G Major, ending in D Minor, and cadencing finally in the parent key of C Major.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">All chromatic options should be available for each Minor key (both major and minor sixths, both major and minor sevenths), which is to say that the best Minor is Full Minor. This exercise, incidentally, presents an ideal opportunity to practice conceptualizing the scale of the approaching tonic as perceived from the root of the dominant. For instance, in the case of B<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–Emi, one perceives the material in E Full Minor first from the vantage point of the root B, then from the root E, as shown in example 39.11.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">This mental rearrangement should be well understood—well <em class="calibre3">seen</em>—at the keyboard and well heard in every tonicization that arises. Conceptualizing tonal material in terms of the approaching tonic is a crucial part of learning your way around tonal territory, and these sequences, with their tight clusters of secondary keys, offer an efficient practice for learning that skill.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The family of keys that centers on C Major also centers on A Minor. Our schema can also be drawn as shown in figure 39.3. The only difference is a matter of emphasis. The efficacy of A Minor as the center can be heard simply by substituting an A Minor cadence at the end of example 39.9, as is shown in example 39.12.</p>

But the domain of the parent key is not necessarily bounded by these six. Any triad contiguous to one of the basic six has the potential to generate a key on the fringe of the core family. Building out from the basic six keys thus yields the extended family shown in figure 39.4.</p>

        <p class="csht">Where Are We?</p>
        <p class="ctx">This might be a good time to review chapter 22, in which we were also talking about extended territory, but within a severe discipline. First of all, all chord progressions were harmonically continuous. Also, although Pythagorean and even whole-cadence relationships abounded, we were not thinking about tonicizing; our intent was to create cogent, balanced harmonic journeys. Nevertheless, it might be clarifying to recognize that the music we are making now is a complication of the music we were making then, complicated specifically by our new ability to be harmonically <em class="calibre3">dis</em>continuous within certain limits, as long as the driving energy is the perfect cadence. In other words, we can leap, but only within a circumscribed family and adhering to the strict cadential formulas. The more one combines harmonic leaping with extended territory, the more tonality becomes unstable, and the more deeply absorbing (and often puzzling) are the possibilities. As the territory increases, the more chances there are for occurrences of commas—more and more Didymic commas at first, rapidly followed by dieses and diaschismas—and the more precariously does the parent key organize and stabilize the harmonic flow. Yet historically we did flock toward this instability like lemmings, and our harmonic centers did begin to wobble, diffuse, and spin in sequences of new tonics. Harmonic models that demonstrate the many fascinating ways this can happen are presented in chapter 41. But even well within tonal boundaries there are a variety of leaping strategies, the most prolific of which involves the dominant seventh chord itself, as outlined below.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-595" class="calibre1"><p class="csht" id="calibre_link-314">A Conspiracy of Deceptions</p><p class="ctx">All of the above modulatory events are predicated on the perception that the chord of the dominant seventh resolves to the tonic. Within the classical aesthetic, other resolutions are possible, but they are all considered more or less deceptions that must later be rectified. Both music and life are full of deceptions, but in music they are usually confined to the kind that lead to desirable twists in the plot. Of course, the too-frequent use of an agent of deception would soon lead us to <em class="calibre3">expect</em> deception, in which case the credibility of the agent would be diffused. This is what happened increasingly to the dominant seventh chord as the nineteenth century progressed: The clear through line of cadence-driven classical form was supplanted by musical impressionism, tone painting, and increasing tonal ambiguity. Although the V<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–I cadence still sounds perfect and right to us, we have learned to hear ways by which a dominant-seventh-type chord can progress to virtually any triad and still make sense in respect to some tonal context or other.

The lattice is remarkably extensive.

        <p class="csht">How To Use the Conspiracy</p>
        <p class="ctx">These regularly resolving dominant seventh chords and irregularly resolving dominant-seventh-type chords we have been examining are not the only modulatory devices under the sun, of course (related augmented and diminished chords are given in chart form in chapter 31), but historically they have defined the evolution of tonal harmony, and they remain one of the sturdiest means of locomotion through tonal territory. Merely knowing that G<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> (or what looks like it) can progress to twenty-four (plus 7) major and minor triads does not necessarily give you mobility in tonal harmony, but it does give insight as to how the tonal web is global, and how, with canny voice leading and a good sense of balance, you can go from anywhere to anywhere and still make harmonic sense.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">My suggestion for harmonic practice using this material is, first, to hear well all of the examples given above, and then, selecting certain ones you are most attracted to, transpose to various keys. The process is like learning to navigate the streets of a city: A map is the first step, then you drive around a lot, then you begin to recognize where you are even though you’ve never been precisely in that place before.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-317" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">When the Pivot Involves a Comma</p>
        <p class="ctx">In the progression C–G<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–C–Ami–Dmi–E<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–Ami there is no ambiguity. The tuning of each chord—that is, its location on the lattice—is perfectly clear. The pivot chord is entirely unambiguous: It is the 10:9 ii in C Major, and it retains that tuning as the iv of A Minor. Pathfinder does not disintegrate, and the ground does not move. No one singing any part would have to adjust pitch in midstream by a comma. The center moves (from C to A), but the pitches stay put. The harmonic landscape is terra firma. This will be true for any matchstick progression, that is, any progression within the logic of continuous harmony.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now consider example 39.48.</p>
        <p class="img">

            <em class="calibre3">Example 39.48</em>
          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">The pivot in this case is the A-minor chord (don’t be distracted by the passing G in the bass), but in just intonation the soprano must raise her pitch by the downbeat of bar 2, so we see that the pivot chord involves a Didymic comma on A. The change of tonal center (in this case C to G) is commingled with the ambiguity of a Didymic comma, and this combination of energies lends to the passage a particular affective quality.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A similar case, involving the dominant triad, occurs in the second bar of the Table of Didymic Triads (example 29.16). As first heard, the chord functions as V of C, but is then immediately recognized as the IV of the subdominant-associated ii; the second function lies a Didymic comma distant from the first. The dominant chord turns into its own Didymic sibling.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It is not an uncommon occurrence for the moment of modulation to be infused with one of the functional commas, thus giving the ear two simultaneous but distinct theaters in which to play out the loss and recovery of territorial certainty—the change of tonic and the navigation of a comma. Many examples of modulation coupled with comma phenomena have arisen in our study. The table of Didymic triads presents a forest of such cases wherein an entire chord functions as its own Didymic sibling. Many uses of the diaschismic tone are modulatory, and the pivot chord is often the point at which a diaschisma occurs (see chapter 32). The juiciest of the modulatory commas, however, involves the three-<em class="calibre3">ga</em> Great Diesis, and I would like to introduce additional exercises to facilitate its hands-on use.</p>

        <p class="ctx">In chapters 30 and 31 we studied all the Great Diesis pairs that could be heard from the vantage point of the key of C. To learn diesis-driven harmony in every key, one needs, in order not to go <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-berserk, a friendly routine, a benign grabber. Dr. Overtone will present two such methods.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The objective of the first method is to become so thoroughly familiar with the harmonic territory <em class="calibre3">between</em> a pair of diesis tones that music can be composed or improvised confidently within that compass. To refresh your sense of this, review examples 30.28–32 and all the examples in chapter 31, paying special attention to the polarity of the flow. Then study the diagram shown in example 39.49.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">This is simply an adaptation of the lattice, with some octaves juggled. At the top and bottom we see the notes of the G<span class="fon">#</span>/A<span class="fon">b</span> diesis; between them runs a central spine of thirds, the two middle notes of which (C and E) are left open. To the right is G, which completes the C-major triad; the A<span class="fon">b</span> associates with this chord as a selective borrowing from the minor mode of C—a reciprocal influx into the C Major matrix. To the left is A, which completes the A-minor triad; the G<span class="fon">#</span> associates with this chord as a selective borrowing from the major mode of A—an overtonal influx into the A Minor matrix. Although there are more notes and more chords that arise in evoking the G<span class="fon">#</span>/A<span class="fon">b</span> diesis (E major and F minor especially), the ones shown constitute the core of the territory and can function as a shorthand while one is practicing in real time. In example 39.50, example 39.49 appears at the top of the circle and is transposed by ascending fifths clockwise and descending fifths counterclockwise.</p>

        <p class="csht">An Opposite Method</p>
        <p class="ctx">The above method might be called the “inside out” method—that is, you stand at a center and look outward, surveying the territory bounded by the north-south diesis. But it is just as useful to be able to point to any tone on the keyboard and make it function as the diesis itself. It is as if you were surrounding the territory by having one foot on the northern boundary (G<span class="fon">#</span>) and the other on the southern boundary (A<span class="fon">b</span>) and from that vantage point looking down into the territory between. This might be called the “outside in” method. For instance, one can learn to recognize instantly that the black note between G and A can function as both the G<span class="fon">#</span> of A Minor and the A<span class="fon">b</span> of C Minor, and then to navigate convincingly between the two meanings. What about the white note below C? That’s harder. (It’s B<span class="fon">n</span>/C<span class="fon">b</span>.) What about the white note between C and E? (It’s either C<img src="000858.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/>/D or E<span class="fon">º</span>/D.) Crunch.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 39.51 features the same material we have just studied around the circle of fifths, but here it is arranged chromatically, beginning with the diesis pair F<span class="fon">#</span>/G<span class="fon">b</span>. Again, the object is not to play through every possibility at once, but to pick a note and try patiently to get it to behave like a diesis.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="ctx">THE DOMINANT-SEVENTH-DRIVEN CADENCES we’ve been examining are the harmonic backbone of European classical music. They depend not only on the contractive force of the dominant seventh chord but also on a rigidly limited modal context. In the common practice period (roughly, from Bach to Brahms), there were only two available modes: Major and Minor. It is true that the Minor mode is somewhat mutable and mixed, and that other modes (not recognized in conventional theory) did come marginally into play, but the system of tonal harmony gained its modulatory force to a large extent by stripping down to the two most stable modes, and by retaining in all cases the major V triad: There is no Dorian in Beethoven. As early as Mozart, most touchingly in Chopin, and later in the Romantics up through Scriabin and beyond, you so often hear the longing to break the bonds of equal temperament and enter into the surviving resonances of the ancient village musics, the exotic modes of the gypsies and the sensuality of the Moors, but cultural pride and racial prejudice allowed the educated Western sensibility only to be titillated (and thereby “influenced”) by “exotic” (read “primitive”) music, never to actually embrace its practice, or the circumstances of its generation.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">By the late nineteenth century, however, modal consciousness had begun to expand, and by the 1920s many composers had developed—as far as possible within the equal-tempered system—a modal sophistication. In modern times we have global access to music that has never lost its modal roots (as ours has for many centuries), and the vitality of modality is all around us. This runs both ways, of course: Non-Western musicians are rapidly becoming users of equal temperament. Consequently there has developed over the twentieth century a new kind of tonal harmony that is not dominant-seventh dependent and does allow the full panoply of modes expressible in equal temperament—not to mention those available in just intonation or “optimal tuning.” This expanded system might be called <em class="calibre3">modulating modality,</em> or <em class="calibre3">modal modulation;</em> it means that one can potentially move from any mode in any key to any other mode in any other key. Some moves are better than others, of course, and this chapter is devoted to searching out the better ones.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Modulating modality was the route that Medieval and Renaissance music had embarked upon in a line of composers from Leonin through Machaut to Lassus and Gesualdo, before the Western ear, to fully realize its preoccupation with tonal modulation, narrowed down the possibilities to those within the two-mode system. By the late nineteenth century, when virtually every modulatory possibility in the Major/Minor system had been explored, Western music split into various camps. On one side of the river, Schoenberg and his followers were spurning the old language; out of its decay grew a new language of atonality, with a new grammar based on the unique powers of equal temperament. On the other bank, the Major/Minor system was evolving into the more diffuse but more extensive language of modal modulation. Shostakovich, Bartók, and Hovhaness are three among the myriad who have developed creative procedures for modal modulation; in more recent times Terry Riley (especially in <em class="calibre3">Salome Dances for Peace</em>) is a leading example. There is, most notably in contemporary Eastern Europe, a trend to incorporate ancient modal practice into modern composition, especially evidenced by the Bulgarian State Ensemble.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">In developing discrimination in modulating modality there are two difficulties: First, the number of possibilities is staggering; second, to take advantage of those possibilities one must have a clear understanding of both modulation and modality. Understanding modulation means facility with commonly held harmonic territory, as well as with dominant-seventh-driven cadences. Understanding modality means, fundamentally, being able to sing in tune musically in a modal system of twelve or more tones. Our purpose here is not to present a complete pedagogy of modal modulation, but to present a practical hands-on method for creatively exploring the territory while analytically mapping it.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-322" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">A Way of Composing in Modulating Modality</p>
        <p class="ctx">Let’s proceed by stringing together a series of modes that will serve as a harmonic template for composition. Then we’ll compose a piece of piano music by allowing, as much as possible, the melodies, rhythms, textures, contrapuntal relationships, and other dimensions to arise from this template.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We’ll presume that the piece begins and ends in the same mode of the same key. Let’s be conservative and choose the pleasant and stable C Mixolydian. First, play the scale. Check out the available triads, four-tone chords, and cadences (see chapter 23). Remember your favorite collections; improvise something. The music need not be dronal, but it does need to sound as though C is the tonic. In other words, don’t let the sense of center revert to, for instance, the more stable F Major, or the perhaps more beguiling A Phrygian, even though in equal temperament those modes comprise the same set of tones and are easy to evoke. To benefit from this particular method, you need to remain true to the mode and tonic you choose. By what criterion do you judge whether or not you have modulated out of C Mixolydian to some other set-related mode? The criterion is your ear. If you hear the music in C Mixolydian, that’s what it’s in.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Next, we need another mode in another key—not too close (since we want a sense of progression) and not too far (since we want a sense of continuity): Let’s try A MA/MI.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">To discover the relationship between the two modes, first notate C Mixolydian as in example 40.1.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">Notice that the first seven tones of the scale—the compass of its tonal content—is bracketed.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Next, notate the tones of the second scale directly below the first, taking care to line up vertically the notes with the same letter name. Bracket the first seven tones of A MA/MI. Additionally, tones that are common to both modes and <em class="calibre3">that lie within the C Mixolydian bracket</em> are then connected by a vertical line, as shown in example 40.2.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice that the A MA/MI scale is extended upward by a tone (to B). Here is the reason: While I am improvising in C Mixolydian I want to be able to read ahead. I need to be thinking in the “old” key while staking out the territory of the “new” key, to see the new key from the vantage point of the old key. While still in old territory, I need to know specifically which tones will stay the same and which will change. This allows me to prepare—in real time—for the immediate future. While playing in C Mixolydian I see that C, D, E, and A are going to be common tones, and that F, G, and B<span class="fon">b</span> will be changing tones. Through ear, eye and mind I lay my strategy and move ahead.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 40.3 demonstrates such a modulation.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Within the first quarter note of bar 3, three common tones are sounding, but the B<span class="fon">n</span> of beat 2 signals a change, and the G<span class="fon">#</span> followed soon by F<span class="fon">#</span> help to define the new mode; the mild ii to i cadence from the end of bar 4 to the beginning of bar 5 further defines A as the new tonic.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The best way to grow into this subject is to practice improvising back and forth between the two modes, convincing yourself that you are evoking the qualities of each mode while discovering new conduits between them. Experiment, and remember the things you like.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">For the next mode, I choose F Lydian, which cancels the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> F<span class="fon">#</span> and G<span class="fon">#</span> of A MA/MI, though retaining the B. In the notation, I will again extend the material of the new scale so that all of its notes appear under the bracket of the old scale, as seen in example 40.4.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Between scales 2 and 3 there are five common tones. Notice also that one of the changing tones is the new tonic (F<span class="fon">#</span> to F<span class="fon">n</span>). Example 40.5 is a modulation from A MA/MI to F Lydian.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Improvise your own modulations back and forth between the two modes, appreciating the appearance and disappearance of the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> energy as you play.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">For the next mode I choose B<span class="fon">b</span> Dorian—a safe way of introducing <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below energy before returning finally to the original key and mode of C Mixolydian. I say “safe” partly because virtually any modal modulation is possible if the tonic changes by a fifth, a subject that is more fully discussed later in this chapter.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">We now have a complete progression of keys and modes. If we agree to adopt the convention of using “key” to refer to both key <em class="calibre3">and</em> mode (as in “the key of C Major,” by which is meant “the key of C and the mode of Major”) then we can call our harmonic journey a chain of keys, or a <em class="calibre3">key chain</em>. Example 40.6 shows our completed key chain.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice that between F Lydian and B<span class="fon">b</span> Dorian there are only three common tones: F, G, and C. The four changing tones comprise the entire <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-spine of fifths of F Lydian, which polarizes to become the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below spine of fifths of B<span class="fon">b</span> Dorian. Example 40.7 shows such a modulation.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The moment of modulation (beat 3 of bar 3) is somewhat surprising in that the tenor moves chromatically from D<span class="fon">n</span> to D<span class="fon">b</span>, yet the harmony is strongly held together by the tones C and F, which are common to both modes. In bars 4 and 5 the remaining new notes (A<span class="fon">b</span>, E<span class="fon">b</span>, and B<span class="fon">b</span>) are introduced more gradually.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 40.8 is a brief composition using all of the above material. Notice how the chromaticism at the moment of transition to final C Mixolydian (bar 19, beat 3), is even more surprising than the chromatic move in bar 15: since both the D<span class="fon">n</span> and the E<span class="fon">n</span> are introduced at the mildly dissonant interval of the major second. By itself this transition would not be very convincing, but in the context of the piece the ear is suddenly set down into territory it recognizes from the opening bars.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As you play the piece, zero in on the flavor of the modulations. You will find that—as will happen in short pieces like this—the modulations are closer to tonicizations: They move through territory rather than settle down into it. In longer pieces the modes can have more time to sink in; but neither way is better. This same key chain could just as easily generate a phrase lasting thirty seconds or a piece lasting ten minutes. In modulating modality, it’s nice to keep moving and it’s also nice to stand still.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A useful exercise is to follow what one might call the history of each note. Examine the key chain again (example 40.6), and track what happens to each letter-named note as it moves down the page. Both D and E remain natural except in B<span class="fon">b</span> Dorian, where they are flatted. F and G remain natural except in A MA/MI, where they are sharped. B<span class="fon">b</span> becomes B<span class="fon">n</span> at the first modulation and returns to B<span class="fon">b</span> at B<span class="fon">b</span> Dorian. Each note tells its own story.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">It is important to have a general idea of where the modes fall on the lattice. This progression clearly rises to <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> land and then falls to <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-below land. But the ambiguities caused by the temperament’s generation of Didymic commas persuades us not to draw too fine a line too soon in using positional analysis. Unless you need to know some particular harmonic detail in the process of composition, save the in-depth analysis for later, when you have become curious as to why your piece sounds so good. (Are the two D’s in bar 8 and bar 9 separated by a Didymic comma? How does that affect the modulation?) The commas that result in a change of spelling are a more pressing matter: Since they generally involve a greater harmonic leap, they should be more consciously and deliberately employed (as we will soon discuss). The important thing at this point is to gain some keyboard facility in equal-tempered modal modulation, and to use the common-tone information as a basic guideline as you scroll down the progression of keys and modes.</p>

Then write a brief composition (between one and two pages—thirty to fifty bars) and learn to play it well. Finally, subject your piece to positional analysis. Unless you already know how, don’t expect to do all this in less than a few hours. Twenty hours over two weeks would not be slow.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-324" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Constructing Key Chains</p>
        <p class="ctx">After having composed at least one piece from a given template of modulating modes, let’s consider the question of what makes a good template. Although this subject is probably more slippery to quantify than the history-sculpted procedures of the common practice period, it is nonetheless possible to point out guidelines according to at least two parameters: common tones between keys, and the relationship between tonics.</p>
        <p class="csht1">COMMON TONES</p>
        <p class="ctx">The clearest example of mutually shared tones lies in what is often taught as the “church modes,” or, thinking simply, the white notes on the piano. By repositioning the tonic we derive C Major, D Dorian, E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, and A Aeolian as a collection of modes that permutate freely among themselves. As mentioned in chapter 24, other types of modes have less prolific repositionings. Modes with four consecutive whole steps (like MA/MI) generate only four usable positions for the tonic; modes containing augmented seconds typically have only two usable positions.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As viewed from the keyboard, these repositionings <em class="calibre3">seem</em> to involve no change of set. But when viewed in the light of positional analysis, the distribution of the Didymic commas, and hence the overall harmonic and intervalic scheme, does indeed change. The D of C Major is not the D of A Aeolian, and so forth, as we have discussed in part 2 and elsewhere. Although it can be occasionally useful, retaining the set while repositioning the tonic is a fairly mild and not entirely satisfying move in equal temperament. It does, however, represent an extreme in mutuality, and one needs to have explored it. Here are three interesting examples. From the church modes: F Lydian to E Phrygian. From modes with four consecutive whole steps: F MIX/LYD to G MI/MA. From modes containing augmented seconds: C HAR.MI/MI.LYD to G HAR.MI/PHRYG.MA (C–D–E<span class="fon">b</span>–F<span class="fon">#</span>–G–A<span class="fon">b</span>–B–C repositioned onto G).</p>
        <p class="csht1">RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TONICS</p>
        <p class="ctx2">
          <b class="calibre8">Parallel modes: The tonic remains fixed</b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">In the case of parallel modes, the tonic (and usually the fifth) remain fixed while the other degrees change, a subject we have studied throughout the first two sections of this book. In extreme cases, six tones can change, as, for instance, between C Lydian and C Locrian. In the less extreme case between C Lydian and C Phrygian, five tones change, and such progressions can be strong. Parallel modal modulation, which moves with a combination of rapid flexibility and grounded certainty, is the basis of much music. The extension of this concept is what we have called the Magic Mode or (for the less roseate-cheeked) the Omnimode, which simply means that all five chromatic pairs are simultaneously potentially active, and that a piece of modal music can flow freely among the various parallel modes of a given tonic (see the <a href="#calibre_link-192">Magic Mode Compositions</a> at the end of part 2).</p>
        <p class="ctx2">
          <b class="calibre8">Tonic Relation by the Various Intervals</b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">To better understand the role that tonic relation has in modulation, let’s first consider the simplest case by confining the discussion to the Major mode only. Compare the number of accidentals in C Major—zero sharps or flats—with the number of accidentals in every other major key, categorized by interval from C, as follows:</p>
        <p class="blockt">up a minor second to D<span class="fon">b</span> Major: + 5 flats</p>
        <p class="blocktb">down a minor second to B Major: + 5 sharps</p>
        <p class="blocktb">up a major second to D Major: + 2 sharps</p>
        <p class="blocktb">down a major second to B<span class="fon">b</span> Major: + 2 flats</p>
        <p class="blocktb">up a minor third to E<span class="fon">b</span> Major: + 3 flats</p>

        <p class="blocktb">down an augmented fourth to G<span class="fon">b</span> Major: + 6 flats</p>
        <p class="ptop">This pure case—all Major modes—gives an idea of the general effect in equal temperament of each modulation solely by virtue of the intervalic relation between the various tonics. In actual music, both tonic and mode will typically change and affect one another mutually. Sometimes the change in mode and the change in tonic will tend to damp each other out: C Aeolian to E<span class="fon">b</span> Major for instance. On the other hand, the mutual effect can be additive. In the case of C Lydian to E<span class="fon">b</span> Aeolian, for instance, there are zero common tones. Although Lydian and Aeolian are both tame modes, and modulating up a minor third in cases of identical modes adds only three flats, this progression would probably not sound cogent unless it were balanced perfectly around some central harmonic territory (B<span class="fon">b</span> Major would serve). Zero common tones will usually break the harmonic thread.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Generally speaking, modal modulations work by balancing changes of tonic against changes of mode. Between three and five common tones (or one could say, between five and three changing tones) seems to work out best in most cases, but everything depends on how changes of tonic and changes of mode affect one another, and on the context of the piece itself. After a certain amount of experimentation you will begin to develop an intuitive feel for these balances throughout the harmonic domain of an entire composition.</p>
        <p class="ctx2">
          <b class="calibre8">Special case: The tonic moves by a perfect fifth</b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">Perfect fifths are harmonically so closely bonded to one another that virtually any modulation is feasible when the tonics are a fifth distant. For instance, in moving from C Lydian to F Phrygian, six notes change, and the modal atmosphere goes entirely reciprocal, but the ear takes it all in, thanks to the fifth between the tonics. This method—not to be overused—is a safe and handy way of connecting even weird and disparate modes.</p>
        <p class="csht1">BALANCE</p>
        <p class="ctx">It would be best to compose key chains containing between seven and ten keys, at least for now. Any number can be useful, of course, but the object here is to learn to construct balanced journeys. These key chains are the same in principle as the triadic odysseys we were constructing in chapter 22. The difference is that instead of triads generating modes, we now have modes generating entire families of triads and other less-consonant packages, allowing each new point of arrival on the lattice to reign over a more active and potentially wide domain. The game is the same, though, as it is in all of tonality: to remain tonally cogent and arrive home successfully. We will find ourselves preoccupied with dissolving the rules of that game later (in chapters 41 and 42), but for now, to learn the subject, it is best for your tonic progression to remain clearly unambiguous; that is, your beginning and ending tonics should be the same note on the lattice, not a comma distant. It is all too easy to overlook displacement by a Didymic comma; if you want to be sure not to do this, plot the tonic triads of your modes just as you learned to plot plain old triads. Returning home a Didymic comma distant will not wreck your life, or your piece, but it is extremely valuable to learn to be balanced as well as complex, and virtual harmonic balance is distinct from actual harmonic balance.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Let’s have another look at the key chain on page 434. The key lattice notation of figure 40.1 shows the tonic triads. Start at 1 and follow the arrows. Notice how the progression moves through three quadrants: southeast to northeast to center to southwest to center. (For a more complete analysis you might draw a lattice showing all of the notes you need, and examine the domain of each mode as it arises, not only from the vantage point of its generating tonic, but also from that of the parent tone, C.)</p>

        <p class="csht1">CHROMATIC PAIRS</p>
        <p class="ctx">Modes often contain one or more chromatic pairs, thereby extending the domain of the mode and enriching the modulatory process. For example, C Mixolydian with two fourths (perfect and augmented) will progress nicely to A MA/MI with two sixths (major and minor), as shown in example 40.9.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">On the keyboard it appears that there are six common tones, and if we did not consider Didymic commas that would be true. However, you might be interested in checking out the difference not only between the two D’s but also between the two F<span class="fon">#</span>’s: The first, <em class="calibre3">tivra ma</em> in C, is 45:32; the second, the <em class="calibre3">dha</em> of <em class="calibre3">dha,</em> is a Didymic comma lower, and the difference in harmonic intention is quite sensible in this modulation. (Modes with more than one chromatic pair are discussed at the end of this chapter.)</p>
        <p class="csht1">WHEN THE COMMON TONE INVOLVES A COMMA</p>
        <p class="ctx">Throughout parts 2 and 3 we have studied how each of the three functional commas can serve to catapult the harmonic energy from quadrant to quadrant within the domain of a parent key. The difference in this chapter is that the parent key is abandoned, at least temporarily. Nevertheless, the dynamics of commas when they are involved in modulation are exactly the same as when they stay centered around one tonic; they simply find themselves in a roving context. We’ll use the Great Diesis as an example to demonstrate our key chain notation. Consider the two modes in example 40.10.</p>

        <p class="ctx">The slanted line connecting C and B<span class="fon">#</span> is dotted, indicating that although the note is the same on the equal-tempered keyboard, the spelling and function have changed. (This harmony appears in example 40.12 below, between bars 12 and 13.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The exercises at the end of chapter 39 under the heading “An Opposite Method” are especially valuable when roving the lattice. It is, perhaps, the epitome of harmonic craft to be able to turn any tone into any comma. Although the “opposite method” has been demonstrated for the diesis, the diaschisma can also play an active (though less frequent) role in modal modulation, and I urge the serious reader to invent his or her own strategy by which any tone on the keyboard can be perceived as a diaschisma. It is not difficult to see, for instance, that F<span class="fon">#</span>, the augmented fourth of C Lydian Minor, could readily become G<span class="fon">b</span>, the minor seventh of A<span class="fon">b</span> Mixolydian; but the obviousness fades (at least for me) when the example is transposed up a half step to the F<span class="fon">#</span>/G diaschismic pair.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The first thing to do is to learn the piece well enough to play it through smoothly, if slowly. It may help to notice how often half steps in each mode are arranged to proceed from a minor ninth to a major seventh, as shown in example 40.13. When you can hear the flow of the piece, go back to its key chain chart (example 40.11) and follow the history of each note. Notice that no tone remains common throughout, and that the sharps (in this case) precede the flats. Figure 40.2 is a map of the tonic chords, shown in key lattice notation. The numbers show the order of keys.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Let’s go through the piece and look at a few things. We have already mentioned the difference in function between the F<span class="fon">#</span>’s in bars 1 through 4 and the F<span class="fon">#</span>’s in bars 6 on. The F<span class="fon">n</span> in the bass of bar 7 creates an augmented octave with the F<span class="fon">#</span>’s in the upper voices on either side, allowing those two kinds of <em class="calibre3">dha</em> to float together in the same space like oil on water. On the last beat of bar 8, the D<span class="fon">#</span> of the E mode appears before the F<span class="fon">n</span> of the A mode is finished, mixing the two modes momentarily.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The C/B<span class="fon">#</span> diesis occurs between bars 12 and 13; notice that it is the C<span class="fon">#</span> in the tenor of bar 12 that effectively changes the mode, although the ear isn’t at all certain of the modulation until the V<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> function in the last half of bar 13. Likewise, A Major clarifies only as it goes along; it is fully clear by bar 16. C MA/MI, however, is immediately clear, forcing the changing tones by contrary motion, as shown in example 40.14.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Notice, however, how this sudden infusion of reciprocal energy requires some time to get used to: Nine bars are spent in C MA/MI—a long time for a piece this short—while the music rambles expansively through a new texture. This allows the three additional flats of B<span class="fon">b</span> Dorian to be more easily accepted in bar 26; the return to the parent key in bar 31 then sounds balanced.</p>

        <p class="csht">Hints for Composition</p>
        <p class="csht1">KEY CHAIN FIRST</p>
        <p class="ctx">My advice for learning to compose, using these broad techniques of modal modulation, is to begin by writing a key chain that convinces you of its effectiveness as you improvise your way through it. Map your tonic triads on a chord lattice, which will serve as a kind of harmonic spell check.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As you first begin to compose, be absolutely faithful to your key chain, even if you have to put aside (not discard) ideas that sound great but are not part of the harmonic scheme. Gradually you will feel free to change your key chain in various ways as you flesh out your piece, and eventually the entire process becomes less linear and more holistic: It is, after all, a creative ideal that all dimensions of a work clarify themselves simultaneously as the work progresses. But for now, be disciplined in letting the harmony rule the content.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The question then becomes when to change the content. Sometimes the same material will endure through several modulations (for example, the first four keys in the above example); at other times a new key will signal new content (bar 17). How do you know when to change? In the case above, the infusion of flats was the trigger; but the answer is, you don’t know, you find out. The entire point of fabricating a harmonic scheme prior to composing a piece is to discover the extent to which interesting and balanced harmonic motion is in itself creative. Under controlled conditions, harmony tells you what to do. It is a clear voice hidden in your ear, an abstruse but radiant guide. When you hear the voice of harmony, you realize that it is that same embodied intelligence that speaks unadorned through the tone-by-tone resonances of just intonation, but concealed and richly thickened by the simultaneously sounding tones of equal temperament. The discipline of composing according to a harmonic plan teaches you how contemporary composition can be a response to primal resonances. So, at least at first, let the harmony write the piece.</p>
        <p class="csht1">A TEXT HELPS</p>
        <p class="ctx">An even more structured discipline is using the key chain method to set texts to music. Each line of a poem, or each phrase, can be used to suggest an appropriate mode in an appropriate key from which a singer’s line can then arise. In this sense, the words write the harmony and the harmony writes the piece—an especially intuitive process conjoining the deepest meanings of both words and music.</p>
        <p class="csht1">THE THREE FUNCTIONAL COMMAS COMPARED</p>
        <p class="ctx">From my point of view the three functional commas do not figure equally in the process of composition. I perceive them as follows:</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Didymic commas I <em class="calibre3">notice,</em> from time to time, as they glide through. They are the least expressive and the most hidden of the commas, and they can stay hidden as far as I’m concerned, unless I need to know about them, which is usually only when I am trying to analyze myself out of an unbalanced or otherwise stuck place, and then I am thankful to know where they are.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Great Dieses I <em class="calibre3">use,</em> as a real-time tool. They are in my ear and in my hands, handy as a Swiss army knife. In the Great Opera of harmony they are active, special characters, always waiting patiently for their cues, often chiming in unbidden to produce serendipitous advances in the plot.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Diaschismas sometimes get pulled out of a hat, but more usually they show up as welcome—if surprising—visitors. Since the diaschisma is the least common comma, it is sometimes the most effective means of modulation.</p>
        <p class="csht1">NONMODAL TONES</p>
        <p class="ctx">Because the modes used in modal modulation are usually not as stable as the major/minor grid of tonal harmony, tones that are not diatonic to the working mode can more easily disturb or destabilize precarious tonics. If tonal clarity is the object, nonmodal tones must be used cautiously. But the criterion is the same as always: If you hear the efficacy of the mode you are in, the mode is efficacious.</p>
        <p class="csht1">TONAL CADENCES</p>
        <p class="ctx">There is nothing wrong with conventional tonal cadences, of course, but remember that they have become conventional because of their potency in focusing tonal gravity. Take care that the strong dominant-seventh-driven cadences of tonal harmony do not overpower the more pastel pushes and pulls of modal modulation.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-327" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Value of the Method</p>
        <p class="ctx">The contemporary composer and improvisor needs to find a way to make sense of a bewildering number of historical and global influences without getting tangled up in any of them. The key chain method is not an end in itself, but a way of developing a sophisticated harmonic language that is informed not only by a wide historical period, but also by the various manners and styles in the world’s living music.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-328" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Modal Limit in Equal Temperament: The Modulating Magic Mode</p>
        <p class="ctx">We’ve seen how individual chromatic pairs figure in the process of modal modulation; we also know that some modes contain several chromatic pairs, and that with proper care, such modes can modulate. In fact, the Magic Mode, which contains all five chromatic pairs (or even more, if you include the Locrian and Super-Lydian options), can be made to modulate through any number of tonics. Does this mean that modal modulation can take the form of a series of Magic Modes progressing from tonic to tonic? Yes, indeed; one could even say that controlling the modulations and mutual influences of the twelve Magic Modes is the ultimate art of tonality. I say ultimate because lying at the edge of equal-tempered tonality is a boundary that separates intricate modal embroidery from finely spun chaos, deep wisdom from utter nonsense, and this boundary can be vanishingly small. One can only too easily find oneself on the unintended side of it. It would be fair to consider all of our labor up to now as an exercise in discerning this fine line.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When you feel you are ready, try your hand at composing a piece of modulating Magic Mode music. Compose many more than one—if not soon, then later. The possibilities of modulating Magic Mode music open themselves gradually over many years.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Art of Virtual Return</p>
        <p class="ctx">A piece that begins in C Major and ends in D<span class="fon">º</span> Major results in a virtual return. In terms of the black and white notes on the equal-tempered keyboard, the piece appears to begin and end in the same key; if the piece is notated, there will be an enharmonic change of spelling at some point, and the music will appear on the page to have returned to the original key. But it has not (see chapter 34). A piece that begins in C Major and ends in the same C Major where it began undergoes an actual return. The difference in effect between a virtual return and an actual return is central to this book. So far, we have concentrated primarily on the limits and the mechanics of actual returns. By using the graphic metaphor of the five-limit lattice, we have seen how every actual return begins and ends at the same location. Now it is time to examine the various strategies of virtual return, all of which involve the lattice folding in such ways as to bring a distant location in contact with the original one. The cyclic sequences in this chapter are a collection of representative cases from every possible type of virtual return, that is, every possible type of folding using a five-limit lattice.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Unless you already are adept at keyboard harmony to some degree, I suggest that you reread (or at least scan) chapter 36 before plunging ahead. It contains a discussion of various diatonic sequences, most of which contain Didymic commas and result in a diatonic version of virtual return. The diatonic kind do not undergo a change of spelling; they are much stronger and more convincing to our Pathfinder nature than the cyclic sequences discussed here. The sequences of this chapter are chromatic; they involve all twelve equal tempered tones, they invariably invoke commas resulting in changes of spelling, and they leave Pathfinder in a swoon. In the course of studying these sequences and comparing them with the unambiguous progressions resulting in actual return (such as the progressions in chapter 22 and the cadences of chapter 38), a profound aesthetic law is demonstrated: The decay of a pure and wholesome simplicity can result in the rise of a sophisticated and useful complexity.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">My grandmother Clara, born in 1876, was a great walker. She would rather walk several miles than take the trolley, thereby <em class="calibre3">earning</em> her destination step by step and concomitantly saving a dime. She stubbornly put off until the age of thirty-five the fretful moment of first stepping into an automobile—which she called a “machine”—and although she lived well into the 1960s she never did board an airplane. “If God had meant us to fly He would have given us wings,” she reiterated over six decades, and perhaps, in a way, her intuition was right.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In 1705 Bach walked over two hundred miles, the legend says, to hear the organ playing of a composer he admired, Dietrich Buxtehude. Country kids of two generations ago would routinely walk several miles to school (“uphill both ways,” they now recall). We moderns who hardly think twice about air travel have very nearly lost all sense of ground distance. Can you imagine with what intimacy hunter-gatherers knew (still know?) the earth beneath their feet, its buoyancy, its generosity in replenishing the walker? We buy our wings for a few dollars, then look down on chunks of the planet from thirty thousand feet up; but for these wings we have actually paid a high price.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In the special kind of travel afforded by harmonically complex equal-tempered music, we have learned the sophisticated mechanics of virtual return, and these have given our ears a kind of jet lag and our musical responses a loss of connectedness. But I don’t think we should give up either our airplanes or our cyclic sequences. We should fly whenever we please <em class="calibre3">and</em> reclaim walking for ourselves; in music we should modulate in any conceivable virtual configuration <em class="calibre3">and</em> reclaim the ability to sing in tune over fixed, unmoving ground. The sequences that follow will teach you every looping design for escaping that fixed ground. They will give you the opportunity to consider from personal experience what is to be gained from such exotic flight. But I hope that, perhaps through their very complexity, they will also remind you of the need to balance earth and sky.</p>

        <p class="csht">Directional Organization of the Sequences</p>
        <p class="ctx">These sequences are organized according to ratios between their tonal centers. Sometimes the tonal centers are transient and suggested by only one chord; sometimes they are clearly established by cadential progressions.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The harmonic field contains the usual two dimensions: the triple nature of 3:2 perfect fifths and the pentamerous nature of 5:4 major thirds (see chapter 29, especially <a href="#calibre_link-469">Magic Mode Compositions</a>figure 29.5). Compass orientation allows motion by ascending 3:2 perfect fifths to be termed <em class="calibre3">3:2 east</em> (or Pythagorean east) or, if they are descending, <em class="calibre3">3:2 west</em> (or Pythagorean west), and allows purely pentamerous motion by ascending major thirds to be termed <em class="calibre3">5:4 north</em> (or pentamerous north) or, if descending, <em class="calibre3">5:4 south</em> (or pentamerous south). Consequently, any vector between horizontal pure fifths and vertical pure major thirds can unequivocally be termed by the compass points in between: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. A complete chart appears at the end of this chapter (figure 41.37). It would be useful at this point to draw a chord lattice in compass orientation, as shown in figure 41.1, from memory. Using graph paper (two lines per inch is convenient) will insure the accuracy of the result.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">To visualize how equal temperament behaves in terms of the five-limit lattice, you must fold the D<span class="fon">º</span> over (left to right) so it touches the C; by courtesy of the temperament, the
Pythagorean comma is distributed equally over the twelve moves so the first chord is identical
to the thirteenth: a Pythagorean virtual return. What does the ear hear? You tell me.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The Pythagorean comma is typically shown by a circle of fifths, the most clear form of
which is shown as figure 41.3a. Notice that the enharmonic change most practicably occurs
at F#/G<span class="fon">b</span>. Of course, any tone could be at the top, so perhaps figure 41.3b is the most useful
configuration (you can spin it).</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Although complete cycles of certain sequences appear in real music, complete cycles of major triads descending by fifths appear almost exclusively in music composed for pedagogical purposes. The Pythagorean comma is distributed in such tiny increments over so many chords, whose harmonic bond is so strong, that the ear cannot get much of a grip on its particular quality. However, parts of the sequence—six chords or more—are usual if not ubiquitous in real music, and for this reason—and because, generally, circle-of-fifth sequences teach you to think by fifths from any tonic—such sequences make excellent keyboard exercises.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 41.2 shows the same root motion, but with dominant-seventh-type chords. Notice that the fifth of every chord is omitted. Also, notice how the upper two parts alternate functions: If you were singing the soprano part, you would begin on the <em class="calibre3">third</em> of G<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> (the tone B), then proceed to the <em class="calibre3">seventh</em> of C<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> (B<span class="fon">b</span>), then to the third of the next chord, then the seventh, and so on. If you were singing alto (try it) you would begin on the <em class="calibre3">seventh</em> of G<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> (F), then proceed to the <em class="calibre3">third</em> of C<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> (E), then the seventh, then the third, and so on. This is easy to understand, and easy to hear if you are singing; but it is not at all easy to hear both upper parts with equal effect while you are sitting quietly at the keyboard playing all the parts—and that is the recommended practice.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The next step is to elaborate the sequence according to the suggestions in chapter 36. This is an important phase of learning keyboard harmony, and is recommended for most of the sequences that follow.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 41.3 shows the same sequence in four parts.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Notice that only half the chords are in root position: Every other chord is in second inversion. Also notice that both the tenor and the bass progress exclusively by whole steps. You may know that there are only two available whole-tone scales in twelve-tone equal temperament; in this sequence, the tenor sings one while the bass sings the other. Why? (Hint: Each move in each part covers the territory of two fifths.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 41.4 is a jazzlike version of the same sequence.</p>

        <p class="ctx">The old bass of example 41.2 is the new soprano, and the old soprano is the new bass, which alternates function with the new middle part (starting on F). The fifths of each chord are again omitted. Meanwhile, the standing dissonances of the major ninth and the major thirteenth alternate function with one another. It is very useful, especially if you are learning to play jazz, to play the left hand as written around the circle and improvise (using either Mixolydian scales or “<span class="fon">#</span>4<span class="fon">b</span>7” scales above each root while emphasizing tonics and fifths), four beats per chord, from slow tempo at first to very rapid tempo.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Although the most singable bass part results in jumping octaves every four notes (as we have done here), this is a tricyclic sequence and hence notated in triple meter.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The sequence falls by thirds and obeys the basic voice-leading mechanics of a diatonic sequence of falling thirds: One part at a time moves contrary to the bass (assuming the bass falls a third, as opposed to rising a sixth). But beyond that, the three upper parts display a most amazing pattern. To discover it, play each part solo. You will find that each comprises a “diminished scale,” a symmetrical scale of alternating whole and half steps. (Symmetrical scales are discussed in detail in chapter 42.) Equal temperament allows the possibility of three such scales, and in this sequence, each of the three upper parts is singing one of them. How can this be? (Hint: A half step plus a whole step equals a minor third, which is also the interval—octave-reduced—covered by a stack of three perfect fifths. This is a tricyclic sequence. It took me decades to figure this out—why should you get it right away?)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The most useful graphic version of the circle of twenty-four chords takes its cue from the chord lattice, which describes a zigzag course moving west, as shown in figure 41.4.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The following sequence is entirely dependent on fluency with the previous one. Beginning with the top C on the piano and descending stepwise, play the remainder of the notes in the upper tetrachord of C Major, namely, B, A, and G. Now play the upper tetrachord of F Major (F, E, D, C); next, the upper tetrachord of B<span class="fon">b</span> Major, then of E<span class="fon">b</span> Major, and so on around the circle of descending fifths until you have played a special kind of scale that descends all the way to the lowest C on the piano.

        <p class="calibre5">Here, each of the twenty-four chords of the previous sequence is preceded by its dominant seventh, resulting in twenty-four pairs of chords, each pair comprising a dominant-to-tonic authentic cadence. In other words, the sequence tonicizes all twenty-four major and minor keys. On the chord lattice it describes a jagged pattern moving inexorably due west, as shown in figure 41.6.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Before you learn to play the sequence, be sure to play each part alone. You will notice that the upper three parts constitute a canon at the fifth below. To discover this, begin with the soprano of bar 1; the next entrance is the tenor of bar 2; the third entrance is the alto of bar 3 (which sounds at the fourth above instead of the fifth below). Also notice that each of the dominant seventh chords appears in second inversion and resolves to a tonic chord in root position.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The sequence should be practiced taking the upper three parts in the right hand. You may find it difficult at first to track twenty-four keys in one pass. But this is one of the most used and useful keyboard practices in all of tonal harmony, and it serves as a kind of initiation into a deeper knowledge of the subject. Any one who can play this sequence rapidly and smoothly (from memory, of course), hear the canon and follow the harmony at the same time, <em class="calibre3">and</em> develop the ability to elaborate upon it extemporaneously, can no longer not be serious. Following are some suggestions for improvising.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If we collapse the harmony so it’s playable entirely in the left hand, the right hand becomes free to improvise melodically. Example 41.7 begins on G<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Remember to think in terms of the approaching tonic (as outlined in chapter 37). When approaching minor tonics, you might use the Utility Minor exclusively in order to simplify the process; but the goal is to be able to use Full Minor for every minor key. You might also eventually consider discretionary borrowing from minor when approaching major keys. All of this will give you a practical cadential facility in all keys, and it’s fun to play besides, especially if you play in time.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">The progression on the chord lattice is due
east, as shown in figure 41.7. “Circle of fifths”
harmony is usually taught as fifths descending. When you hear the sequence of fifths ascending for the first time it sounds unfamiliar, yet at the same time entirely true. Notice that there is no melodic discontinuity in the upper parts as there was in the descending version (example 41.1) or its diatonic ancestors (example 36.8). To best understand how pianistically benign the upper three parts actually are, play them together in the right hand (without the bass), observing all ties; then add the bass in the left hand. When you can play the model smoothly from memory, try elaborating it according to the suggestions in chapter 36.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">How does your ear hear the Pythagorean comma in this case? The comma is still distributed over too many strong moves for my ear to glean any characteristic affect from it, but, true to its yin roots, the ascending version of the sequence seems to have less stability and more mystery than the descending version, rendering the comma slightly less invisible, perhaps. In any case, of all virtual returns, this one seems to me least disquieting. My Pathfinder knows for sure that it is not the real Homebody pouring tea, but there seems to be an especially calm acceptance of the fact. Like sequences of descending fifths (and unlike pentamerous sequences that achieve a much more heightened affect with fewer, weaker moves) this sequence does not occur in complete form in actual music. Bits and pieces of it show up continually, of course.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When improvising over this sequence, the major scale of each chord will generate the most familiar-sounding passing tones. But there is another handy option: To better prepare for the upcoming key, you can Lydianize your scale <em class="calibre3">before</em> changing the harmony. For example, start with C Major, introduce the F<span class="fon">#</span> of C Lydian, <em class="calibre3">then</em> move to G Major (which has the same notes as C Lydian) for a moment, then G Lydian, then D Major, and so on.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Another option for elaboration of the above sequence is to use the tonic of the old key as a 4-3 suspension into the new key. Example 41.10 is the model.</p>
        <p class="img">
          <img src="000897.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Again, learn the upper three parts in the right hand alone first, observing all ties and making a sweet legato. You will notice that only one part moves at a time. Solving the legato problem (without pedal, if possible) helps you internalize the harmony well enough to use it musically.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Root motion by ascending fifths is even more mysterious if every chord is minor, as shown in example 41.11.</p>
        <p class="img">

        </p>
        <p class="ctx">When improvising on this sequence, try using all Aeolian scales at first. Then, taking a cue from example 41.9 above, Dorianize as you go. In other words, play in C Aeolian, then, to prepare the next key, natural the A, thus playing in C Dorian, then move to G Aeolian (which contains the same notes as C Dorian), then play in G Dorian, and so on. You might try other flavors of Minor in various combinations; the goal, again, is to have the option of using the complete range of Full Minor for each new key.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The sequence in example 41.12a adds 4–3 suspensions to each triad.</p>

        <p class="ctx">It is not obvious why this sequence, even in its unelaborated model form, is so beautiful. Even though it sounds so transparent and nourishing to the ear, its use in real music is remarkably infrequent. Again, I don’t think the beauty is in the evocation of the comma so much as in the sheer yin pleasure of ascending Pythagorean motion, combined with suspended minor triads. In any case, it is made for learning and enjoying. Example 41.12b is an elaboration of a complete cycle using Full Minor.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Example 41.13 is a sequence of full cadences descending by thirds through all 
twenty-four keys, with the IV and V triads in first inversion. The second chord 
of each bar can be heard simply as a repositioning of the tonic chord.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Improvising on this sequence is much like improvising on example 41.6, but balanced by subdominant harmony in each key. The beauty of the first inversion chords inspires the improvisation.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 41.14 is the “Neapolitan sixth cadence” resolving to twelve minor keys ascending by fifths. We have studied this harmony as a “Phrygianization” of the approaching tonic; the value here is to feel the Phrygian energy of each key come into your fingers before it yields to conventional minor.</p>

two fifths, down one, up two, and so on, thus making its way on the lattice due east. Every
leap of two fifths is filled in by the root leapt over, weaving a taut cadential fabric. Notice
also the two alternating versions of cadential voice leading.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">On the chord lattice the progression leapfrogs due east; the roots ascend at the ratio of
9:8. Because it takes only six chords for it to cycle around, the character of the comma seems
faintly sensible to me: It is the single case of a functional Pythagorean comma that I know of. Although the roots describe a whole-tone scale in equal temperament, the placement of the major triads on the chord lattice is unambiguous. What do you hear? For the less compelling westward-bound version, play it backward. Then transpose it a half step to get at the other six major triads.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">As we shall soon see, harmonic discontinuities more extreme than this, even within the relative safety of the central Pythagorean spine, give rise to tonal ambiguities.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The spelling makes the Great Diesis visible: Every third chord generates a diesis for each tone of the triad. Yet there <em class="calibre3">are</em> only three chords, and the original pitch—entirely sensible—does not move. Like a Mevlevi dervish, we sense both our spinning and our standing still. Such is the aesthetic of equal-tempered harmony: Are we whirling about in the world, or are we standing fixed while it whirls about us? Purely pentamerous harmony signals the endgame of tonality, and in these sequences of major thirds you can hear quite clearly the mechanics of tonal dissolution. And, just as in dervish whirling, there is an ecstacy in it, a kind of <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-cubed frenzy that gets inside of us and holds on. Play example 41.18 until you’ve had enough; then read some more.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Example 41.19 has the same tonal material, but now each chord is a dominant-seventh-type chord, and each has four positions (root position, first inversion, second inversion, and third inversion).</p>

        <p class="ctx">If you compound two fifths down with one major third up, the result, after octave reduction, is a 10:9 major second, also called a minor whole tone (to distinguish it from the 9:8 major whole tone). The class of sequences whose tonics progress by minor whole tones is of special interest because such progressions are easily confused with the stronger, more forthright Pythagorean progressions involving major whole tones. The distinction is both subtle and profound, and to appreciate it fully one must experience again the difference in quality between those two resonances in just intonation. (This subject was introduced in chapter 10 and developed in chapter 29). The most common <em class="calibre3">re,</em> for instance, is 9:8 with <em class="calibre3">sa;</em> in contrast, the most common <em class="calibre3">dha</em> is 10:9 with <em class="calibre3">pa</em> (both readily singable using the C and G drones of the equal-tempered keyboard). The act of internalizing such distinctions is the missing link in our culture’s comprehension of harmony. If we had not lost the living experience of these resonances, our musical thought would be more lucid and our music might have attained an even more enduring vitality. As it turns out, the missing link is you—singing, feeling vitalized by the various resonances, and carrying this experience forward into equal-tempered music.</p>

The result describes a southeastern journey on the lattice that is a perfect vector between rising fifths (due east) and falling thirds (due south).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">At first blush, the above sequence might seem to be some kind of descending Pythagorean harmony, since that is how we are conditioned to think about such chromatically descending sounds. To better appreciate the true mix, try playing example 41.16 (major triads ascending by 9:8), then example 41.18 (minor triads descending by 5:4), then alternating between those two several times, then finally playing example 41.36 again. What do you hear? When the sequence finally comes around to D<span class="fon">º</span>, incidentally, the compound comma is one overtonal Pythagorean comma (twelve fifths) minus two Great Dieses (six major thirds), again not a sensible compound comma. The harmony gains its quality essentially from its direction and its internal Didymic commas.</p>

In some cases we do flirt with directional confusion, and in a few cases we are downright confounded. Now we come to a class of sequences that weaken the tonal bonds even further, allowing the fine, mesmerizing quality of symmetrical harmony to emerge fully as an inherent quality of the equal-tempered system. Let’s begin by examining what could be thought of as a prototypical progression by equal-tempered minor thirds.</p><p class="csht1">QUADRISECTIONS OF THE OCTAVE</p><p class="ctx">If you divide the octave into four equal intervals, you will derive an equal-tempered diminished seventh chord. Because it is perfectly symmetrical, any of its four tones can function as its root, and it can resolve with equal effectiveness to any of four different tonics. This subject has already been introduced in the context of centered tonality (see chapter 31, <a href="#calibre_link-470">DIMINISHED SEVENTH CHORD</a> and especially example <a href="#calibre_link-471">31.31</a>). Now we will deal with the cyclic properties of diminished seventh chords.</p><p class="calibre5">Let’s build a chord starting with the tone E. Go up three semitones to G, another three to B<span class="fon">b</span>, and three more to D<span class="fon">b</span>. Out of context, the tonality of this collection is so ambiguous that it has neither root nor proper spelling; we will call it the <em class="calibre3">x</em> chord. Tonal context will give the tones meaning, that is, function, and thus proper spelling. The four most available resolutions are as shown in example 41.40a (choosing minor tonics rather than major tonics).</p><p class="img"><img src="000945.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><em class="calibre3"><b class="calibre8">Example 41.40a.<br class="calibre1"/>
The x chord</b></em></p><p class="calibre5">Now start with D<span class="fon">#</span> and build a chord that quadrisects an octave. We’ll call it the <em class="calibre3">y</em> chord.

The z chord</b></em></p><p class="calibre5">Practice these twelve vii°<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>–i cadences until they become familiar to hand, eye, and ear. Try substituting the parallel major triads for the minor triads (F major instead of F minor).</p><p class="calibre5">Here is another way of approaching the same phenomena. Play the <em class="calibre3">x</em> chord (E–G–B<span class="fon">b</span>–D<span class="fon">b</span>). Lower the soprano part a semitone (D<span class="fon">b</span> becomes C). The four tones now unequivocally form C<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>. Put the soprano back where it was and lower the alto a semitone (B<span class="fon">b</span> becomes A). The four tones are now E–G–A–C<span class="fon">#</span>, or A<sup class="calibre11">7</sup>. Put the alto back where it was and lower the tenor: F<span class="fon">#</span><sup class="calibre11">7</sup>. Put the tenor back and lower the bass: E<span class="fon">b</span><sup class="calibre11">7</sup>. These four chords constitute a set of related dominant-seventh-type chords that are all harmonically equidistant from the same quadrisecting chord—in this case, the <em class="calibre3">x</em> chord. There is another set for the <em class="calibre3">y</em> chord and another for the <em class="calibre3">z</em> chord, as shown below.</p><p class="calibre5">Example 41.40d shows all twelve dominant-seventh-type chords arranged according to the diminished-seventh-type chord from which they are equidistant. At first, simply repeat the four chords in each bar as a closed loop. Notice where the whole step (or minor seventh) falls within each chord, and how it travels. Also, the last chord of each set is related to the first chord of the next by a descending fifth, so the entire collection of twelve chords sounds quite remarkable when played straight through.</p><p class="img" id="calibre_link-472"><img src="000948.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre2"/></p><p class="cap"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">Example 41.40d</em></b></p><p class="calibre5">As you may have sensed, each closed set is exquisitely ambiguous.

<p class="p">    Symmetry abounds in all directions. The top three parts seem to be an elaboration of a single diminished-seventh-type chord (the <em class="calibre3">y</em> chord, in this case). The bass line is a chromatic scale. Considering all four parts, the first and fourth beats of each bar form the closed loop of dominant-seventh-type chords that surround the <em class="calibre3">y</em> chord (see example <a href="#calibre_link-472">41.40d</a>). This loop could be heard as traveling either Pythagorean east or pentamerous northwest, or as purely symmetrical. But there are other tonal seasonings in the stew as well. The first three chords, for instance, could be heard as part of a <span class="fon">b</span>VI<sup class="calibre11">aug6</sup> cadence centered on C minor; the next three chords, an identical cadence centered on A minor, and so on, traveling northwest. Furthermore, the sequence could be terminated at any time by treating any of the dominant-seventh-type chords as actual dominant sevenths: The downbeat of bar 2, for instance, could resolve the F<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> to a B<span class="fon">b</span><span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">6</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span> chord.

<p class="calibre5">This harmony, which gives the ear so much choice at every turn, was much adored by late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Romantic composers, and learning to improvise on it will give valuable insight into that sensibility.</p></div>

        <p class="ctx">Although there are an infinite number of sequences and cadences possible in twelve-tone equal-tempered tonal harmony, I think we can now fairly claim to have studied examples from every useful nook and cranny of the diatonic and cyclic territory. What remains fades into symmetry; what we have not yet examined completely is the behavior of symmetrical scales and chords. A great many twentieth-century composers have been fascinated by the cusp between tonality and symmetry, and that will be our focus too, in the following chapter.</p>

      <p class="ctx">THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF TWELVE-TONE EQUAL TEMPERAMENT was to make available a harmonic language of twelve equally useful tonal centers. The delights of ranging through this vast new field eventually outweighed the irritations of its tuning compromises, and over the course of the nineteenth century the Western ear fully explored and internalized the now-standard system of tuning. But I doubt if any musician alive in the mid-eighteenth century suspected that the new tuning harbored within itself an entirely new musical force.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-340" class="calibre1"><p class="csht">The Equal-Tempered Chromatic Scale</p><p class="ctx">The new force arises from the ear’s response to a succession of tones equidistant from one another. On the equal-tempered keyboard, play a chromatic scale evenly, without particularly choosing where you begin or end. The ear hears the even spacing between the pitches with the same kind of perception with which the eye sees the even spacing of a picket fence or the lines of type on the printed page.</p><p class="calibre5">In just intonation, no such thing occurs. A just chromatic scale is quite uneven, containing a wide variety of semitones depending on the tuning, potentially including not only the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-blooded 16:15, 25:24, 135:128, and 27:25 but also the Pythagorean 256:243, as well as the septimal 28:27 and 21:20. To hear such chromatic scales played smoothly and rapidly sounds haphazard and unmusical; indeed, they have the cumulative effect of a poorly constructed picket fence. Even in the various unequal temperaments (including meantone and Bach’s well temperaments), a chromatic scale has nothing of the smooth sheen ours possesses.</p><p class="calibre5">Before the days of equal temperament, the tones of a chromatic passage were heard in terms of their harmonic function. Revisit example 37.16 and sing each tone of the slowly rising scale in just intonation as a functional resonance (including the dissonant but compelling 45:32 F<span class="fon">#</span>). The issue of equal distance is nowhere in sight. What we get is a cogently bonded melodic ascent accompanied by wildly divergent harmonic contrasts: rare, but dramatically useful when used in moderation. Likewise, if you tune a keyboard (electronic or acoustic) to some version of the just chromatic scale and play it slowly over the tonic or dominant, you can also hear the widely divergent harmonic effects; if you play the same just scale rapidly over several octaves but out of tonal context, the harmonic effect disappears and the melodic residue is simply uneven—in fact, it sounds out of tune. Now play the scale rapidly on the equal-tempered keyboard and hear how the various harmonic functions similarly disappear beneath the gloss of evenly spaced percussive events.</p>
<p class="p">    What are we actually hearing? In our earlier discussion of cents (the measurement of intervalic distance—see chapter 16), we saw that just resonances are expressed by rational, whole-integer ratios and equal-tempered intervals are expressed by irrational ratios, and that these two kinds of number are fundamentally different. The most common just semitone is the rational 16:15; the equal-tempered semitone is the irrational <span class="formula"><span class="sqrt"><sup class="root">12</sup><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="root1">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span>:1</span>, or 1.0594631 . . . :1. Does this mean that just resonances are sane and equal-tempered intervals are crazy? No, because rational and irrational numbers are equally crazy. What it does mean is that the music these numbers express belongs to separate orders of experience.</p><p class="calibre5">An equal-tempered chromatic scale out of context is purely melodic and <em class="calibre3">merely</em> chromatic (see chapter 35); it has no tonal function and no proper spelling. It is difficult for the modern ear, which takes such things for granted, to imagine how the new aural artifact was heard by the eighteenth-century ear, but the surviving literature tells much of the story. Chromatic flourishes in Bach are rare (and usually appear in the context of descending diminished triads), but by Mozart’s time, chromatic scales in cadenzas were common. Between 1750 and 1790, as equal temperament became more the rule than the exception in Europe, and as it became more familiar, composers and improvisors gradually began to respond to its newly available effects. By the early nineteenth century, chromatic scales were part of the compositional fabric.</p><p class="calibre5">Play an equal-tempered chromatic scale again, up and down several octaves in one hand, not too fast, and let your ear savor its regularity, its newfangled, manufactured, precisely measured <em class="calibre3">sameness</em>. Don’t be bored, be fascinated, mesmerized. This sensibility opens the door for the more complex symmetrical forces hidden inside the Trojan horse of equal temperament.</p></div>

        <p class="csht">The Equal-Tempered Whole-Tone Scale</p>
        <p class="ctx">Someone—presumably by the mid-nineteenth century—had to be the first person to hear an equal-tempered whole-tone scale as a musical event. One day, no doubt seated at the piano, something new registered in that person’s ear, a new possibility leapt from an old sound. Did that musical explorer exclaim? Frown? Smile and squint into the future?</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Like chromatic scales, whole-tone scales have both tonal and symmetrical functions. The term <em class="calibre3">symmetrical</em> refers to the precisely repeated patterns of intervals afforded by twelve-tone equal temperament. Symmetrical scales are organized by such patterns, and symmetrical harmony arises from them. The chromatic scale offers the simplest pattern: successive semitones. Before looking at the symmetrical effect of successive whole tones, let’s first examine the harmonic function of whole-tone scales in just intonation.</p>
        <p class="csht1">TONAL PROPERTIES OF THE WHOLE-TONE SCALE</p>
        <p class="ctx">Consider the passage in example 42.1.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">The scale in example 42.1 might be termed C MA/PHRYG (see chapter 24). The harmonic context renders unambiguous in equal temperament the five descending whole tones from B to D<span class="fon">b</span>—they are respectively, the 15:8 major seventh, the 5:3 major sixth, the 3:2 perfect fifth, the 4:3 perfect fourth, the 6:5 minor third, and the 16:15 minor second.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now consider the same tones played as shown in example 42.2.</p>
        <p class="img">

        </p>
        <p class="ctx">In place of the D<span class="fon">b</span> we have the augmented tonic, C<span class="fon">#</span>, which is most immediately recognized as the augmented fourth above G, a tone we have named the super-Lydian (see chapter 32) and which makes, with the D<span class="fon">b</span> of the first example above, a diaschismic pair of tones spanning the Super-Lydian/Phrygian compass in the key of C.</p>
        <p class="csht1">SYMMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE WHOLE-TONE SCALE</p>
        <p class="ctx">Now let’s consider the same consecutive whole tones removed from any tonal context. They constitute a <em class="calibre3">sextatonic</em> (six-tone) symmetrical scale with no tonal center and no proper spelling. There are only two whole-tone scales, or <em class="calibre3">sets,</em> in twelve-tone equal temperament.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-521" class="calibre12"></a><a href="#calibre_link-474" class="calibre12">*32</a></sup> The set we have been discussing is composed of the two grouped black notes plus the four white notes normally called F, G, A, and B; we’ll call this the <em class="calibre3">alpha</em> set. The other is composed of the three grouped black notes plus the white notes normally called C, D, and E; this we’ll call the <em class="calibre3">omega</em> set.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Play the alpha set as a scale, evenly and not too rapidly, in one hand over several octaves. As with a chromatic scale, appreciate the even spacing of the tones, the precision of the neverending sameness. We like it. Try the omega scale. We like it the same: two parallel, symmetrical six-tone universes.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Using the three-white, three-black omega set, try the harmonies in example 42.3.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">From the omega set alone, these combinations and many others can be derived, plus, of course, their transpositions to every other scale tone, since it is the nature of whole-tone symmetry that any intervalic structure built from one tone can be built from any other tone in the set. Example 42.4, for instance, shows the third chord of example 42.3 redistributed and transposed to every other tone in the omega scale.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">When you consider the possibility of transposing any combination to any tone and redistributing it to any octave in any rhythm, you can construct a freewheeling but consistently symmetrical music resembling, perhaps, example 42.5.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now try improvising using the alpha set. Then try the omega set. Then alternate between the two, switching back and forth with increasing frequency. Such music may seem slightly obvious to our generation, but in 1890 scarcely a soul had thought to hear this way. One can easily imagine the first hoots of derision: “ungrounded noise,” “the annihilation of the known world,” and so forth, but the enticing fluidity of whole-tone symmetry led a host of composers including Rimsky-Korsakoff, numerous French Impressionists, Vaughn Williams, and many others to routinely employ its shimmering, floating effect.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The “rules” for making music based on symmetrical scales seem both minimal and self-revealing: There are only a certain number of combinations; whatever can be constructed from one tone can be transposed to its symmetric equivalent; every combination is potentially useful; what sounds best <em class="calibre3">is</em> best. What interests us specifically in this study is the conjoining of tonal and symmetrical energies, their many intriguing ways of alternately grounding and vaporizing our Pathfinder sensibility.</p>
        <p class="csht1">THE CUSP BETWEEN TONALITY AND WHOLE-TONE SYMMETRY</p>
        <p class="ctx">Consider again example 42.2. Realize that although the first bar functions as V<sup class="calibre11">7</sup> harmony, all of the notes in that bar are members of the same (alpha) whole-tone set. Only at the resolution, in the second bar, do members of the other set appear. Now, remembering that what is constructed from one tone of a whole-tone scale can be transposed to any tone, you can see how there are five other transpositions of the dominant function within the alpha set, as shown in example 42.6.</p>
        <p class="img">

          </b>
        </p>
        <p class="ctx">The first three beats of each bar are members of the alpha set, which has been appropriately spelled according to the tonal context of each bar.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Now, to remind yourself of the floating nature of the symmetry without tonal context, play the alpha whole-tone scale up and down with your right hand against the nonresolving bass of example 42.7 in your left hand.</p>
        <p class="img">

        </p>
        <p class="calibre5">Tonally, where are you? Without the resolutions you are on a spinning wheel, though you could choose to get off the wheel at any point. The whole-tone scale thus functions as a kind of <em class="calibre3">pivot scale</em> that, like pivot tones and pivot chords, looks simultaneously in more than one direction—in this case, in six directions. Such fluid symmetries bridge tonality and atonality much in the same way that water, as an intermediate state, bridges ice and steam.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Incidentally, if you want to experiment with a special kind of atonality generated by whole tone sets, try improvising with the alpha set in your right hand and the omega set in your left. Be sure to cross hands, and to interlock them as well.</p>

        <p class="csht">Diminished Scales</p>
        <p class="ctx">Another type of symmetrical scale arises from the alternation between whole tones and semitones, generating an eight-tone, or <em class="calibre3">octatonic,</em> scale, as shown in example 42.8.</p>

        <p class="ctx">To better understand the place of such scales in the twelve-tone scheme of things, let’s go back to the three diminished seventh chords—or octave quadrisections—of example 41.40d. Remember that there is no proper spelling for these events; we will use the <em class="calibre3">x, y,</em> and <em class="calibre3">z</em> nomenclature.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">There are three diminished scales in twelve-tone equal temperament. One way to find them is to first play the <em class="calibre3">y</em> chord (up from C) in your right hand; then, placing your left over your right, play the <em class="calibre3">x</em> chord up from D<span class="fon">b</span>, as shown in example 42.9.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">I have given these scales with the initial pitches C, G, and F and begun each with the semitone. But the scales could begin on any pitch, and just as easily begin on the whole step. Any method you have of conceptualizing the three diminished scales and putting them into your hands is OK as long as it works. Although they fall easily under the fingers, diminished scales are hard to keep straight. Perhaps understanding the tonal uses will make them easier to grasp.</p>
        <p class="csht1">THE TONAL PROPERTIES OF DIMINISHED SCALES</p>

But octatonic harmony has become overly familiar in the entertainment industry. Beginning in the 1930s, composers for radio, films, and later, television used the quality of endless limbo peculiar to this harmony to keep audiences on the edge of their seats in fear and apprehension—to keep them, in a word, in suspense. The following scene, for which example 42.21 supplies the musical background, is typical of a 1940s radio script. The thirty-five-member studio orchestra is poised and ready to play. Quiet please.

        <p class="ctx">The most interesting and enduring use of symmetrical harmony seems to be when the listener can appreciate both the symmetrical and the tonal properties within the same context. The effect is something like having part of your consciousness in orbit while the other part is grounded on earth.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In example 42.22 the <em class="calibre3">x</em> + <em class="calibre3">z</em> diminished scale serves as a pivot scale between keys progressing by ascending minor thirds, moving southeast on the lattice of keys.</p>

        <p class="csht">Augmented Scales</p>
        <p class="ctx">Just as diminished scales can be thought of as combinations of two interlocked diminished seventh chords, augmented scales can be thought of as two augmented chords. In equal temperament there are four augmented chords, each trisecting an octave. As symmetrical phenomena these chords have no proper spelling, so we will arbitrarily assign them the letters <em class="calibre3">m, n, p,</em> and <em class="calibre3">q</em>, as in example 42.24.</p>

The remaining two-chord combinations result in the new sextatonic symmetrical scales shown in example 42.25. Notice that these are all versions of the same scale, transposed to four pitch levels and starting with either a half step or an augmented second.</p>

The upper tetrachord is HAR.MI; the lower trichord (we will temporarily coin this word) simply alternates or combines major and minor thirds. The perfect fifth above the tonic offers tonal stability. The <em class="calibre3">m</em> + <em class="calibre3">p</em> and <em class="calibre3">n</em> + <em class="calibre3">q</em> versions reverse the positions of the tetrachord and the trichord, leaving only the perfect fourth above the tonic to give Pythagorean stability to the mode.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">Notice that example 42.30 uses only one of the four possible combinations—one might say transpositions—shown in example 42.26. When transpositions are used, however, the listener is not expected to distinguish one transposition from another as one senses modulation in tonal music. Rather, symmetrical techniques, partly because of their spinning cyclic harmonies and partly because of their repeated intervalic patterns, can keep tonality evenly at bay with an unsettled, hovering, shimmering quality. The composer’s harmonic skill often lies in controlling the consistency of that quality.</p>
        <p class="csht1">THE CUSP BETWEEN TONALITY AND NONATONIC SYMMETRY</p>
        <p class="ctx">In comparison with tonality, symmetry is a weak force, by which I mean that the ear’s perception of symmetrical intervalic patterning is easily submerged in and superseded by tonal gravity. One of the ideals of twentieth-century composition has been the development of a harmonic language wherein spinning symmetry and grounded tonality fade in and out of one another according to the dramatic needs of the music. As we have seen, it is not difficult to set modulatory harmony to spinning, nor is it difficult to evoke the various symmetrical properties of cyclic harmony. The art lies in the balance. To gain insight into the middle ground, it is operationally best to separate the two forces as much as possible. Learn your tonal and cyclic sequences. Learn the symmetrical properties of the temperament. Then you can experimentally discover your own sense of the interface between symmetry and tonality, and your musical research will have a personal slant to it and eventually become part of your individual style.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-344" class="calibre1"><p class="csht">Equal Temperaments with Other Than Twelve Tones</p><p class="ctx">It comes as a great and usually delightful surprise to most musicians that there exist a large number of possible equal temperaments, some of which have novel and absorbing musical properties (most notably nineteen-tone equal temperament). I recommend the interested reader to the works of Easley Blackwood, the universally acknowledged maestro of and authority on this subject. Blackwood’s CD <em class="calibre3">Microtonal Compositions</em> (Cedille CDR 90000 018) is a revelation of the musical potential of equal temperaments from thirteen to twenty-four tones per octave, and is most highly recommended. His book <em class="calibre3">The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings</em> (Princeton University Press, 1985) is devoted in part to a mathematical quantification of the theoretical possibilities of microtonality.</p><p class="csht1">QUARTER TONES</p>
<p class="ctx">Musicians often use the term <em class="calibre3">microtone,</em> which means any small interval, when they mean <em class="calibre3">quarter tone,</em> which means half a semitone. The music in which quarter tones most usually occur is Arabic music, where typically they bisect major/minor chromatic pairs. It is most interesting to note that the tone located dead center between the 5:4 E and the 6:5 E<span class="fon">b</span> also exactly bisects the 3:2 perfect fifth C to G, and is thus <span class="formula"><span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="root1"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span>:1</span>. It is an equal-tempered tone in that it divides the perfect fifth into two equal parts. The astonishing thing about this tone is its affect, which functions strongly in both the rational and irrational worlds. We will call it the <em class="calibre3">quarter-tone third;</em> it is useful to look it up in the “Glossary of Singable Tones in Just Intonation” to better understand how it sits in the scheme of things.</p><p class="calibre5">The quarter-tone third is precisely centered between two strong internal norms, the just major and just minor thirds, that is, the most familiar overtonal and reciprocal pentamerous tones. From the point of view of resonance, the quarter-tone third has no inherent quality. Like the geographical center of the United States, it is not particularly interesting in itself; its position defines it. Consider the exact middle of a bridge that spans the yang shore and the yin shore; the midpoint is poised between extremes, at the place of balance. Similarly, the quarter-tone third is balanced between major and minor, equally pulled by two complimentary states.</p><p class="calibre5">As you can see from the “Glossary of Singable Tones,” other fifths along the Pythagorean spine are similarly split: Midway between the Pythagorean B<span class="fon">b</span> and F lies the quarter-tone second (it splits the 16:15 D<span class="fon">b</span> and the 10:9 D); midway between the F and C lies the quarter-tone sixth (it splits the 5:3 A and the 8:5 A<span class="fon">b</span>); midway between G and D lies the quarter-tone seventh (it splits the 9:5 B<span class="fon">b</span> and the 15:8 B); and midway between D and A lies the quarter-tone fourth (spitting the 45:32 F<span class="fon">#</span> the 27:20 F). It is not surprising that Arabic musicians, coming from a culture of great mathematical insight, were the ones to develop sensitivity to this class of tones.</p><p class="calibre5">How to hear these tones? Find some good Arabic music and listen up. My lifetime source is Hamza El Din, one of the greatest living musicians, emissary of Nubian Nile-hugging villages now flooded over by the Aswan Dam. From his music for oud and voice, the quarter tones, poised between lament and celebration for the tribal life of his childhood, pour out. Of all tones used in the music of the world, these are the ones I personally find most enigmatic. On a good day I can find, and use, the quarter-tone third; the others I consider works in progress.</p></div>
      <div id="calibre_link-345" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Beyond Tonality and Symmetry: Atonality</p>
        <p class="ctx">It is possible to annihilate tonality without deliberately using the force of symmetry as a reference. There have been many experiments in bitonality (two keys at once—for instance, C in the right hand and F<span class="fon">#</span> in the left) and even pantonality (twelve saxophone players improvising simultaneously, each in a different key). Many composers simply compose by ear, maintaining the chosen distance from tonality on a bar-by-bar basis, hoping that the cumulative effect achieves the desired balance. The line between developing a multitonal style and simply muddying the tonal waters is fine. At its worst, such ear music is a litany of “wrong notes”—things that are heard as sounding right because they wreck other things. At its best, the composer reveals a new kind of light. The task for each musician is to discover the most suitable vectors between modality, tonality, symmetry, and the ear’s intuition. All music is, finally, ear music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Music that has no tonal reference is called atonal, but so persistent is the force of tonality that one must go to special lengths (at least in twelve-tone equal temperament) to exorcise any perfect fifths or major or minor triads that could cue the ear toward a tonal center. Such a weeding out seems like a negative process to some, who term atonality “the music of avoidance.”</p>
        <p class="calibre5">This is not the book to describe the various techniques of dodecaphonic (twelve-tone) composition, although I’ll mention two. The first might be called “fresh tone” technique: One simply keeps track of the tones that have been used in such a way that one may employ the least-used, or freshest, tone at any moment. The second, called serialism, arranges the twelve tones in a fixed order, or <em class="calibre3">twelve-tone row</em>. Each row has innate properties (including the possibility of symmetry and not precluding tonality) that suggest compositional direction and expansion. Schoenberg, in the early 1920s, was the first to articulate the discipline, which followers observed more or less strictly. By the 1940s Messiaen and others began to serialize additional dimensions, including rhythm and dynamics. Stravinsky shocked some by producing serial compositions in the 1950s (even though his interest in symmetry goes clear back to the Symphony No. 1 of 1905); by the 1980s the technique was becoming widely abjured by those who formerly espoused it.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The atonality of dodecaphonic music is the antithesis of the harmonic resonance of just intonation. It replaces the sensual correspondences of sound and psyche with intellectual perceptions of temporal order. Yet something entirely wonderful can occur in such music, a luminescence that is seen through no other window.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Dr. Overtone says: Learn everything. The jewel is everywhere. No one has a corner on the good music market.</p>

        <p class="csht">The Three Lattices</p>
        <p class="ctx">There are three types of lattice, each of which corresponds to a separate order of musical magnitude. The <em class="calibre3">tone lattice</em> (or <em class="calibre3">lattice of tones</em>) can display in staff notation the derivation by perfect fifths and pure thirds of every tone used in a tonal composition. At the same time, it gives an immediate overview of the harmonic territory. The resulting configuration of the axes is called <em class="calibre3">staff orientation</em>. For visual ease in separating overtonal from reciprocal thirds, the diamond-shaped note heads of the central spine of fifths are left open; all others are filled in. Triangles may be drawn outlining the major and minor triads, using solid lines for perfect fifths and major thirds and dashed lines for minor thirds. Additionally, letters indicating the names of the triads may be placed in the center of each triangle, for instance C and Cmi (or cmi, lattices being the single acceptable context for the use of lowercase letters indicating minor triads). The details of constructing a tone lattice are revealed throughout part 1, especially chapters 10 and 16.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A <em class="calibre3">chord lattice</em> is an extrapolation of the tone lattice, a lower magnification of it, so to speak. The staff notation and the triangular boundaries are gone; what remains are the chord symbols. These then may be connected by solid lines along all the Pythagorean spines. 
Additional solid lines may connect all relative and parallel pairs; dashed lines are used for additional mediants and submediants. Furthermore, to show all available contiguous harmony, lines may be drawn connecting all chords a fifth distant (see chapter 21, especially figure <a href="#calibre_link-477">21.3</a>). If the purpose is to retain direct reference to the tone lattice, it is good to remain in staff orientation. However, when dealing with chordal motion through time (as in the cyclic sequences of chapter 41, for instance), it is best to align the axes perpendicularly in <em class="calibre3">compass orientation</em> (see chapter 29). Also, it is often clearer to omit chord symbols not under scrutiny by simply leaving a blank space (or a dot) where the letter name would have been.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The <em class="calibre3">key lattice</em> looks like a chord lattice, but its purpose is different. It represents only the tonic triad of each key through which the music modulates, and thus serves to condense an entire piece so it can be seen at a glance. Unused keys may be omitted, or shown by a dot only.</p>

Now we’ll use the same noteheads in the conventional manner to represent rhythmic differentiation; the result will be a real-time notation of just intonation. Let’s begin by reviewing our spine-specific symbols. Figure 43.1 shows them in open noteheads.</p>

        <p class="csht">Medieval Music in Tone Lattice Notation</p>
        <p class="ctx">Tone lattice notation is most suitable for music that can be performed with few or no Didymic commas, and the Medieval literature abounds with such pieces. <em class="calibre3">Fumeux fume</em> by Solage, a French composer who flourished in the late fourteenth century, is a remarkable mix of architectural subtlety and pentamerous sweetness. This rondeau was evidently composed for a “society of smokers”—possibly of opium or hashish—who no doubt delighted in the stylistic mixture of delicate whimsy and intricate design. The sense of the text is:</p>
        <p class="poem">
          <em class="calibre3">A smoker through smoke</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem1">
          <em class="calibre3">who smokes smoky ideas</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem1">
          <em class="calibre3">will find smoking to his liking</em>
        </p>
        <p class="poem1">
          <em class="calibre3">if he keeps his head clear.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="ptop">The harmonic motion of Solage’s piece is almost grotesquely extended, yet the journey through the vast territory is beautifully balanced and entirely believable. The net result is hardly caprice, but rather, deep satisfaction. A most wonderful thing is that there is no harmonic ambiguity. No singer or player needs to sing or play through a single comma, and each part has modal as well as melodic integrity. Positional analysis will demonstrate these various aspects.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Our reference recording<sup class="calibre19"><a id="calibre_link-522"></a><a href="#calibre_link-478">*33</a></sup> is performed by a countertenor and two vielles.

        <p class="calibre5">With a little practice, tone lattice notation will come to represent actual sounds in your ear. It helps to remember that when reading through a single part you are usually dealing with tones from adjacent spines of fifths. The general harmonic neighborhood is also clear from the page. <em class="calibre3">Fumeux fume</em> begins on the subdominant version of a ii chord, with the 10:9 <em class="calibre3">re</em> (G), located in the northwestern territory of relative minors and their overtonal <em class="calibre3">ga</em>’s. By bar 6 the music has gotten itself to the territory of parallel minors and their reciprocal <em class="calibre3">ga</em>’s, eventually cadencing strongly, in bar 8, on F.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The entire harmonic journey, all forty-three smoky bars of it, can be clarified by chord lattice notation. In the case of fourteenth-century music, however, letter names represent not so much fully expressed triads as more or less specific sites where the music alights. Because it is impossible to follow the chord-by-chord detail of such a long journey in one diagram, figure 43.3 shows the harmonic motion in twelve stages, vertically aligned. Reference bar numbers appear along the arrow’s path.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Doesn’t it even look a little like smoke? Yet the music never loses its harmonic intention. It keeps its head clear and is to our liking. Of course, all this analysis has to be meticulously put together with the sound of the actual music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">It cannot be emphasized sufficiently that neither the composer nor the musicians of his time, nor the members of Ensemble PAN (who are exquisitely in tune), used our clever lattices to produce their music. The composer, working from his keen ear and vivid sense of style, did <em class="calibre3">not</em> have a well worked out, practical theory. He knew by intuition and experience what sounded agreeable. Likewise, the musicians worked out the best sounds intuitively, bar by bar. All praise to the compassionate intelligence that creates music prior to music theory.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">And yet . . . now that we have come to a clearer understanding of the harmonic finery through graphic images of vital resonances, perhaps its beauty can become even more accessible to modern ears.</p>

The lattice of tones is shown in example 43.9. The numbers near the tones refer to the first appearance of that tone in the music. The first number is the bar number; the second refers to the note’s position in the bar counting from left to right and bottom to top. For instance, in the second bar, A is 2,1; the next B is 2,2; the bass E is 2,3; C is 2,4; D<span class="fon">#</span> is 2,5; the B above it is 2,6; and so on.</p>

These tones represent a beautiful harmonic extreme introduced as a final burst of reciprocal energy just before the end of the piece. You may also notice that the territory encompasses four Didymic commas, three Great Dieses, and two instances of a new comma, the <em class="calibre3">superdiesis</em>. One of these latter is between G<span class="fon">b</span> and the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> F<span class="fon">#</span>, the other is a fifth higher, between the D<span class="fon">b</span> and the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> C<span class="fon">#</span>.

        <p class="calibre5">To benefit most from all of this analysis, you need to learn the piece well enough to hear it clearly without playing it. (It’s worth it.) Then, after comparing the various ways in which the tones have been analytically organized, read the tone lattice notation while sitting quietly. Then play the piece again at the equal-tempered keyboard. The analysis will help you appreciate the music; the music will help you understand the analysis.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">One clear fact that emerges from all this is Bartók’s immaculate modal sensibility—which is not surprising, since he was deeply devoted to the indigenous music of his culture. Also, as a speller of music his grade is A+: a perfect paper. Music such as this can guide us in bringing forward the deepest possibilities of modality and modal modulation in equal temperament.</p>

        <p class="ctx">Sometimes composers discover things that make other composers jealous. Maybe that is the real reason behind Dr. Overtone’s tireless, ferretlike efforts. A composition student of mine, a connoisseur of fine harmony, showed up one day, flung a page from Gabriel Fauré’s <em class="calibre3">Requiem</em> onto the music rack, and demanded, “What <em class="calibre3">is</em> this?” The passage occurs at rehearsal letter “E” of the “Agnus Dei.” In example 43.12 I’ve reduced the harmony to four parts and transposed it up a major third to avoid enharmonic spelling changes.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The chord lattice notation of figure 43.5 shows how the passage ends a Didymic comma lower than it begins. In order to accurately represent the virtual return that occurs in equal temperament, one must ask: Where is the comma distributed? The hatch marks in figure 43.6 shows my interpretation: I think the Dmi—D<span class="fon">b</span> area between bars 3 and 4 is the most likely place, even though the music is sequential at that point.</p>

        <p class="csht">Mozart in Positional and Traditional Analysis: Sonata in C, K.545</p>
        <p class="ctx">One of the most useful traditional analytical practices is the reduction of a score to a continuous progression of four-part chords that optimize the melodic and contrapuntal weave. The progressions are made to resemble harmonic models as much as possible. In such an analysis, the essential notes of the composer’s bass are generally preserved intact (though not necessarily in their original octave), and all other aspects of the piece, including especially the tunes, are expunged for the purposes of perceiving the fleshless harmonic skeleton. The reduction is then played as rapidly as possible, as if to present the harmonic journey of the piece in one cogent moment. This practice, though requiring some skill, is the quickest, clearest route to understanding European classical music, not only in its formal aspect, but also in the deepest aspects of its interpretation. My purpose in discussing the traditional method here is to demonstrate how positional analysis is an extension of this practice—another antenna, so to speak, or a different frequency of light with which to examine the same object. I have chosen one of the best known (and also one of the best) pieces in the literature, the first movement of Mozart’s Sonata in C, K. 545, composed in his full maturity, in 1788, when he was thirty-two.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">First, get the piece from your shelf (or buy a copy, for heaven’s sake) and play it (one more time), or review it in your head. Then play the reduction in example 43.13 smoothly, gracefully, musically, and as fast as possible.</p>

It is like walking into a freshly built house and feeling the balance of its design sans paint, rugs, drapes, furniture, or even people. The truth is, a thousand entirely different perfect pieces could be created by fleshing out this skeleton, just as a thousand different interiors could furnish a beautifully made home.</p>

        <p class="calibre5">The arrangement of keys forces a virtual return, a Didymic comma distant from the starting key. This may have contributed to Mozart’s highly unusual choice of recapitulation in the key of the subdominant, a tonic (F) that at least bends us westward after uninterrupted eastward travel. But there is another view. If we assume that the Didymic comma is absorbed somewhere early in the development (between bars 29 and 38), the lattice shown in figure 43.8 appears more balanced.</p>

        <p class="ctx">“Harmony is form” may seem like an extreme statement, but if we take harmony to mean the agreement among tones, from individual notes in a melody to chains of tonics in a symphonic movement, it is not difficult to see that the more the harmony is felt and understood, the clearer becomes the structure of music at every level.

        <b class="calibre7">R<small class="calibre4">EVIEW OF THE</small> T<small class="calibre4">HEORY</small></b>
      </p>
      <p class="ctx">HERE, FOR REFERENCE, IS A SUMMARY of the theory:</p>
      <p class="calibre5">We recognize low-prime frequency ratios between tones as more than agreeable—they are affective in various ways. The primes two, three, five, and seven serve as norms that are both given by nature and internalized by experience: inner/internalized norms. The overtone series is only one incarnation of this, not the source. The primes three and five and their compounds and their reciprocals interweave, forming a lattice of tones and compound tones that can be displayed on a two-dimensional lattice, called a five-limit lattice, that confers on each tone a specific locus, or position, and imbues it with a sense of distance from and orientation to the center. By singing in just intonation against a drone we can experience in depth the pull of the tones and their affective nature. Tonality is the ear’s ability to recognize and respond to the generating prime in a system of tones. Most of the world’s modes are thus discrete selections from the five-limit lattice (plus a few seventh and even higher partials).</p>
      <p class="calibre5">With the exception of the octave, none of the available harmonic combinations of twelve-tone equal temperament are tuned precisely to just intonation, yet its twelve tones can, under certain conditions, be heard as referring to, or <em class="calibre3">standing for,</em> the thirty-odd specific sites on the five-limit lattice. These references are most specific in the context of “matchstick” harmony and most of cadential harmony. The more specific and unambiguous this reference to low-prime ratios, the stronger the sense of tonality. As ambiguity increases, tonality weakens, resulting finally in the emergence of the affective force inherent but hidden in the tuning: its symmetry and ultimate atonality.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Ambiguity in equal temperament results from confusion between pairs of tones on the five-limit lattice that are near in pitch but distant in harmony, called comma siblings. In equal temperament, commas may be evoked instantaneously, or their force may be distributed over several beats. Each of the ambiguities that result from the various commas has its own mathematical quantification as well as its own qualitative affect, and all of the ambiguous harmony in equal temperament can be organized accordingly.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">The Pythagorean comma (twelve fifths is not equal to seven octaves) is mathematically prior to all of the commas, but rarely functions in actual music.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">The Didymic comma (four fifths is not equal to two octaves plus a major third) arises often in diatonic situations and in modulations to nearby keys.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">The Great Diesis (three major thirds is not equal to an octave) arises from mixing over-tonal and reciprocal thirds, a confounding of parallel and relative realms. Diesis harmony is either overtonally skewed (the overtonal family) or reciprocally skewed (the reciprocal family); in either case its three major thirds imbue it with the strongest affect of all the comma harmonies.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">The diaschisma (four fifths plus two major thirds is not equal to three octaves) has a wider territory but a somewhat weaker affect than the Great Diesis. Again, there are two families: the <em class="calibre3">ga</em>-balanced family, and the <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em> family, each producing an array of harmony.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">There are, in addition, various quasi-functional and nonfunctional commas.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">From these considerations, a shape for equal-tempered tonality emerges: Tonality is dynamic through time, by turns a two-dimensional plane (when unambiguous) and variously folded in a third dimension (when ambiguity evokes commas). Sometimes the ambiguity involves the central tone itself; a return to an ambiguous tonic (i.e., a pitch removed from the original tonic by one or more commas) is called a virtual return. It is possible to organize the various pathways of virtual return by an array of cyclic sequences, all of which are presented in positional analysis (the assignment of a piece’s constituent tones to positions on the five-limit lattice). Positional analysis affords various notations that track the harmonic path of an entire piece through time.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Tonality in just intonation is an open system whose limits are defined by the capacity of the individual ear to relate compound tones to a generating tone. Tonality in equal temperament is an open system whose limits are defined by our sensitivity to the symmetric affect inherent in the tuning, which, at a certain point, becomes greater than the affect generated by the reference norms.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">A précis of the summary: In equal temperament, everything tonal is composed of either unambiguous perfect fifths and major thirds or the quantifiable, sensible ambiguities among them, or is scattered by symmetry.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-359" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Value of the Theory</p>
        <p class="ctx2">Assuming that you find the resonances of just intonation real, and that they serve as the norms of equal temperament, and that the inherent ambiguities of equal temperament result in a network of commas that are functional and affective for you, the theory and its consequent practices may be valuable in a variety of ways:</p>
        <p class="blockpi">It draws unique distinctions. The theory allows you to draw subtle but real distinctions between harmonic values—especially between Pythagorean and pentamerous values—that have not heretofore been theoretically provided for.</p>
        <p class="blockp1">It organizes tonal harmony. On the basis of these distinctions, all available tonal harmony in twelve-tone equal temperament can be organized and thus made more accessible for hands-on use.</p>
        <p class="blockp1">It defines harmony as form. The affective qualities of perfect fifths and major thirds operate in tonal music over every musical order of magnitude, from tones to symphonies, from Medieval modality to twentieth-century cyclic harmony verging on atonality. The theory gives a handle on how the harmonic drama of centering and dispersing is played out at every level. It demonstrates how elemental harmonic principles are architectonic—that is, how their structure controls or directs other structures—and how this active, forming energy cuts both ways across the orders of magnitude, from tone lattices to key lattices. By this method, one begins to grasp the dialectic of extremes, that is, how the smallest elements and the largest formal shapes are mutually nourishing.</p>
        <p class="blockp1">It promotes self-clarity. Because the work involved in learning these principles is so highly experiential, the theory throws you back onto your own perceptions, into your own hearing. Ultimately, one senses how the lattice is an expression of an inner working, and how harmony is the geography of the mind.</p>
        <p class="blockp1">It gets you unstuck. Even though we learn music by imitation and are beholden to our teachers and our legacies, we don’t want anything or anybody to stand between us and the source of sound. We want direct access. The theory allows you to track your stuck places back to the source, both conceptually and inspirationally, so your music can move forward.</p>
        <p class="blockp1">It reveals a hidden gift. Although we began our work with a search for what is innate and ancient in human hearing, and were thereby led through an interior world of harmonic resonance, we eventually found ourselves in a forest of temperament, only to emerge with a realization that equal temperament, with its inherent diminution of resonance, is nonetheless a radiantly beautiful gift, one of many from the musical gods.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-360" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Flaws and Limits of the Theory</p>
        <p class="ctx2">It is useful not to be too in love with one’s own notions. The reason Dr. Overtone’s profile can sometimes be observed well after midnight silhouetted against the spill of his reading lamp is that he is reflecting on the nature of music and music theory. Here are some of his nocturnal thoughts:</p>
        <p class="blockpi">Anyone can create a subjective tautology. The notion that affective commas are the driving force behind equal-tempered harmony can never be objectively proved. What is presented in this book is an elaborate, operative system based on what is presumed to be the clear sensibilities of the investigator. No matter that you, the reader, are exhorted to be the true center of the investigation—the power of suggestion and the prose of a musical pen have swayed many a cynic. Anyone can claim inherent powers for any numbers <em class="calibre3">x</em> and <em class="calibre3">y</em> and construct a theory as neat as a pin. Subjective tautologies are easy to build and require little or no maintenance. What we may have here is an elaborate grammar for a made-up language.</p>
        <p class="blockp1">Music is culturally determined. Music obviously changes dramatically across cultural boundaries, and even the most widespread popular music is not universal. Just as there is no universal language or grammar, there is no single unifying musical principle, no “one ear.” Simply examine the world’s music—the differences will convince you.</p>
        <p class="blockp1">Aesthetic norms are wishful thinking. Since nothing is ever in tune anyway, and it is impossible to prove the existence of any harmonic norm, inner or outer, perhaps “approximations” don’t approximate anything; maybe they are simply what is heard. Why can’t things simply sound the way they do? Tunings fall where they fall, end of story. The tunings of Shona <em class="calibre3">mbiras</em> vary from village to village. Likewise, the tunings of Balinese gamelans change from tuner to tuner—in fact, each gamelan has its unique tuning. Even accurate-sounding European singers slide around incessantly like tobogganers. Under the circumstances, how can one ever distinguish the various “approximations” from one another, or the various commas from one another, or the approximations from the commas? We hear what we hear.</p>
        <p class="blockp1">The theory is too shallow and too narrow. It is generally accepted that meaning, especially musical meaning, arises from many operations on many levels in the brain. A harmonic theory that places so much emphasis on the primacy of small-integer ratios would have to be part of a much larger picture taking into account more levels of perception. Furthermore, on the microend, the theory says nothing about the organization of waveforms themselves, or the electric signals triggered by them on the neuron level. The substantive answers would seem to depend on the analysis of brain activity involved in the decoding of those signals.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-361" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Doctor’s Comfort</p>
        <p class="ctx">Now I’ll tell you some of the thoughts that comfort the Doctor in the wee hours.</p>
        <p class="blockpi">There are undoubtedly valid reservations about the efficacy of this modern theory of affects. But the work we do is art, not science; its subject is subjective experience, and its method is the self. The thinking reader must stop thinking, at least for a sufficient period, and sing. Ultimately, no single mode of activity sways us: We must sing, think, play, compare, reflect, listen to the world, and finally sort it all out for ourselves. In reply to written queries the Doctor sends a form letter: “Sing a few pure tones against a drone per day, and send me a postcard in a month.”</p>
        <p class="blockp1">There is a wonderful play by Bertolt Brecht called <em class="calibre3">The Life of Galileo</em>. In the first act, members of the Florentine ruling class, including the court mathematician and the court philosopher, have come to Galileo’s home ostensibly to view for themselves the newfangled, highly controversial telescope. Galileo entreats them to look through the instrument and observe for themselves the “Medicean stars,” the satellites of Jupiter. “I fear things are not quite as simple as that,” replies the philosopher, who, together with the mathematician, dispute their way beyond the necessity of observation. As they depart, Galileo runs after them, imploring, “But really, you need only look through the instrument!”</p>

        <p class="csht">Whose Theory Is It?</p>
        <p class="ctx">I would like to make the modest claim that neither I nor my comma sibling, Dr. Overtone, nor any of our lackeys, have created anything new. Speaking for myself, I think I did happen to be standing at the right place at the right time (if you could describe the urge to produce a nearly six-hundred-page book “right”). By this I mean that I grew up musically primarily through jazz, that my embrace of European pedagogy came later (in my twenties) and did not close me off from other music, that I had a natural proclivity for Indian and African music, and that I enjoyed the benefit of master teachers from many musics. That is to say, I was alive and well in America in the late twentieth century, and it was time for someone to love music sufficiently in a certain way <em class="calibre3">and</em> at the same time to have had a mediocre early training: I <em class="calibre3">had to know,</em> or I would never have developed as a musician. I am a stubborn man; if I deserve credit, it is for persevering until I heard what was true for me. Most of the ideas themselves were already in the air, waiting for someone to organize them and write them down, and under Dr. Overtone’s stern gaze and mercurial smile, that is what I have tried to do.</p>

      <p class="ctxtop">IN LIGHT OF THE EXPERIENCES AND DEFINITIONS that have arisen during the course of this study, I would like to make some comments about the way we make and teach music, especially composition. Also of special interest is the question of how music and brain form each other, and indeed, the mutuality of music with all of life.</p>
      <p class="calibre5">Let’s begin by reviewing the present limits of both equal temperament and just intonation, and then examine various ways of stretching those limits.</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-364" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">The Limits of Twelve-Tone Equal Temperament</p>
        <p class="ctx">The most limiting aspect of twelve-tone equal temperament (other than its restriction to twelve tones) is that only the ratios 2:1 and 3:2 are close enough to their just norms to unequivocally represent them. Every pentamerous, septimal, or compounded event is an out-of-tune approximation that generates its tonal meaning by musical context. The system can be seen as a continuum of such situations whose ambiguity gradually increases until context no longer generates tonal meaning, at which point the inherent symmetry, with <em class="calibre3">its</em> limited number of possibilities, emerges. The twelve tones of equal temperament give a lot, but they also make the ear work overtime with little rest. The composer Mike Ellison, speaking of composing in equal temperament, once said, “Even when things are going well, the notes are never good enough.” That seems true even when listening to Mozart on a good day: The ear gets tired and restless in twelve-tone equal temperament.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Historically, the systemic limits of twelve-tone equal temperament have long been reached and overreached. The trillions of combinations have all been sorted out many times over. That doesn’t mean that there is no more equal-tempered music left to be made, of course, only that the language itself doesn’t seem to have anywhere to grow without reaching over the fence. Nevertheless, here are three possible ways to transcend the limits:</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">1. Greater sensitivity to the referent.</em> I say that everything has been discovered, and it has, but I think that as resonance revives in the West, more people will be able to use what is already known and used by a few. For instance, a musician especially sensitized to the 25:24 C<span class="fon">#</span> in just intonation will be able to evoke it reliably and creatively in equal temperament. The more frequently a culture physically experiences 25:24 as a resonance (and understands it through positional analysis), the more contexts for that tone will arise, and the more musicians will use them with sure footing and clear intention. If the cultural experience of just intonation were more cogent and conscious, there would be a more responsible use of extended modal and tonal harmony in equal temperament: that is to say, better music.</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">2. More than twelve tones to the octave.</em> Much work has already been done in equal-tempered scales containing more than twelve tones to the octave, especially with nineteen-tone, thirty-one-tone, and fifty-three-tone equal. These scales generate extraordinary, fascinating new harmony, some of it quite musically compelling. The problem with such scales is that the difficulties in placing the pitch of twelve equal tones, already legion, are horribly magnified. Few players of variable-pitch instruments, and fewer singers, are willing or able to learn to accurately place the pitches of nineteen, much less thirty-one or more, equal-tempered tones per octave. Some promising fretboard instruments have been built, but for the most part, these temperaments, fascinating as they are, depend on our symbiosis with electronic machines. This may not be all bad, but the inherent limit of twelve-tone equal temperament—that it is removed from the direct experience of resonance—is not transcended here, it is made more complex. Again, however, let me recommend Easley Blackwood’s <em class="calibre3">12 Microtonal Etudes,</em> especially the nineteen-tone piece. Creasing the brain into nineteen tones turns out to be very seductive. (The tone [at 252.6 cents] that effectively splits a perfect fourth [at 505 cents] is definitely attractive; see his 
	<em class="calibre3">Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings,</em> chapter 12.)</p>
        <p class="calibre5">By considering both headings above (greater sensitivity and more notes), one can begin to imagine the possibilities of extended modality in nineteen-tone or thirty-one-tone equal temperament. This is an open subject, a virgin field that composers will undoubtedly work as the musical quality of electronic instruments improves. Its great hope lies in retaining the balance between the just referent and the symmetrical aspects of the temperament.</p>
        <p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">3. Cooperation with allied systems.</em> From its earliest use, equal temperament has, under certain circumstances, made friends with just intonation (see chapter 35). In modern times, these circumstances have grown in scope until equal-tempered keyboards and fretboards commonly combine with a wide array of just scales from around the world (including the overtonal Tuva singing of Mongolia), with results that are sometimes felicitous and sometimes obscene. What cures obscenity is empathy, which is precisely what just resonances, whose very essence is connectivity, bring forward in musicians. The more completely musicians are trained to be in tune, the more constructive become the alliances between the equal-tempered and the just-tuned worlds.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-365" class="calibre1"><p class="csht">The Limits of Just Intonation</p><p class="ctx">The limits of just intonation are also clear: The farther you move from the center (or the more the center itself moves), the more territory is involved. More and more notes sprout up, and the system becomes increasingly complex, until the ear can no longer distinguish among its elements. How to transcend those limits?</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">1. More singing.</em> There is a growing awareness of just intonation among composers, performers, designers of instruments (acoustic as well as electronic), and even market researchers, but not a commensurate increase in the number of folks who are experiencing the resonances for themselves. There is too much number crunching and future making in the air, and not enough resonance. Many people who write treatises on just intonation, and who design and program instruments intended for reproducing it, simply cannot sing in tune, as crazy as that sounds. The truth is that listening to music in just intonation is such a pure experiential hit that people become involved in the subject as listeners only, with the result that their responses are too easily intellectual. The nitty-gritty of singing in tune does not seem relevant for most, so it is not surprising that the treatises and instruments and programs are awkwardly off the mark. They come from concepts, not experiences.</p><p class="calibre5">So the first way of widening the meaning of just intonation is to learn to sing it, and then to teach others. The most efficient pedagogy of just intonation is probably well-taught North Indian music (which means 
	<em class="calibre3">no equal-tempered harmoniums</em>), but that is hard to find in the West. This book suggests an alternative—the guitar-and-lattice approach—but there will arise other teaching methods as resonance revives. Notations that guide the singer and player may be of some help, but the ultimate answer lies with each musician, who has to demonstrate by his or her example the energy that just resonances open out into the world. Musical resonance is a lit torch that passes from one person to the next.</p><p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre3">2. More notes.</em> Many composers and theoreticians become fascinated with various arrays of increasingly complex ratios. These can be generated by two means: higher compounds and higher primes. In both cases, the pertinent issue is how far the ear can follow.</p><p class="calibre5">In the case of higher compounds, let’s consider, for instance, compounds of the prime three. Is the Pythagorean major seventh (3<sup class="calibre11">5</sup>, or 243:128) sensible? Evidently so, since it occurs widely in music that is sung and played by variable-pitch instruments. Is the Pythagorean augmented fourth (3<sup class="calibre11">6</sup>, or 729:528) sensible? Can you sing it? I think I can, but I’m not sure. It shows up in Pythagorean systems. What about its reciprocal, the Pythagorean G<span class="fon">b</span>? Or what about two fifths plus two thirds up, the 225:128 A<span class="fon">#</span>? Dr. Overtone doesn’t allow that one, but maybe you can find it and experience its affect. Would you use it even if you couldn’t?</p><p class="calibre5">In the case of higher primes, much experimentation has been done with primes over seven. When these tones are limited to their noncompounded versions as they initially occur in the overtone series, the ear seems more easily to make sense of them. But taken individually, one must ask of each the critical question: Do you hear it well enough to sing it? The thirteenth partial seems to be at the cusp. Terry Riley says he knows where it is, hears it in extant music, and uses it; with Ben Johnston’s help, I’ve recently learned to sing it and am now trying to figure out how to use it. But what about the higher primes: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37? I am dubious that the ear distinguishes these, but they show up in computer-generated music as if it did.</p>
<p class="p">    Some composers feel that even though they can’t reproduce a high prime or a complex compound vocally, when they tune it mechanically they are nonetheless registering its affect. In this way, huge compounds are generated, as well as their reciprocals—for instance, three perfect fifths below plus two septimal sevenths below: <span class="formula"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">(</span><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)/(</span><span class="denominator">3<sup class="calibre11">3</sup> × 7<sup class="calibre11">2</sup></span><span class="ignored" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true" data-AmznRemoved="mobi7">)</span></span></span>, or G, 2048:1323. A composer tunes the note mechanically, checks the inside of his skull, and says, “Yes, it has an affect,” and proceeds to use it in his piece, or in his life’s work, which is then regarded as mystical. Or, to consider an even more removed situation, a theoretician likes the look and feel of the numbers, and so includes the tone or tones in his system.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is this a musical process? It all depends on your aesthetic slant. Maybe the perpetrators of such mentally led activity are fooling themselves, and us, with their alluring ideas. Maybe the detractors, the ones who say, “If you can’t sing it, don’t use it,” are cutting themselves off from a vital part of their own responses (possibly because they have already been duped too many times by intellectually top-heavy art).

        <p class="csht">Why Is Just Intonation Not Taught?</p>
        <p class="ctx">Although musical resonance is passed individually from musician to musician, just intonation is rarely taught as a method in the West; indeed, there is resistance to teaching it. Why? Until very recently, most of its pedagogy has been more mathematical than musical, and its musical behaviors and applications have not been commonly understood. Consequently, most teachers feel threatened by it. They have invested their lives in perceiving music a certain way, and of course, that is the way they have to teach. Even when new ways of perceiving the intuitive do arise, as is the present case with just intonation, the mechanics of transmitting them from teacher to student take time to develop. Furthermore, the West is not a humble culture. It took our ethnomusicology over a generation to shake off its paralyzing condescension, and European concert music, like an aging patriarchal bully, had to be well over half dead before it began to actually listen to its down-home neighbors (not to mention its own early history). Slowly but inevitably, the fact that equal-tempered music is only a slice of the global pie is being recognized less as a threat and more as a creative opportunity.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I hope that someday all ten-year-old kids will know the overtone series like they know their multiplication tables and that the singing of just resonances and the construction of just scales will be part of our sense of place in the natural world. Were that to come to pass, equal temperament and its musical domain would come into historical perspective. The distinction between what people ordinarily think of as “progress,” in the sense of “breakthrough” (which is not necessarily continuous with the past), and “evolution” (which is) parallels the distinction between equal temperament as it is ordinarily perceived—that is, as being discontinuous with its dronal and modal roots—and the continuum of harmonic experience we have presented in this book. There is evolutionary value in demonstrating the acoustical basis of equal temperament because it presents equal temperament as a stage of development, not as an end in itself. We can now see equal temperament as part of the flow of history rather than as a radical separation from it. Just intonation is not some primitive, threatening voodoo but a generative source, both internal and external.</p>

        <p class="csht">Future Music and the Collective Ear</p>
        <p class="ctx">Currently there is a surge in the desire to hear through the collective ear, to grok the global sound of music, to use it, to earn the right to say, “There is only one pair of ears <em class="calibre3">and I can hear through them</em>.” Fabulous collections of world music, variously categorized and packaged, are being marketed and mass marketed, and more are coming. In light of this impulse, it is tempting to speculate on some future world music, some kind of musical Esperanto, or to envision great global endeavors.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-525" class="calibre12"></a><a href="#calibre_link-484" class="calibre12">*36</a></sup></p>
        <p class="calibre5">These foretellings may be exciting, but thinking about the future can be a trap if it takes you too far away from the work in front of you. Our first work as musicians is to take responsibility for our immediate soundscape, both inner and outer, to listen locally and hear globally, and to know what we hear. The real value of knowing what you hear is that it helps open yourself to the shared norms that unify the disparate dialects of the world’s music, to feel at home with the prime language, the human core. That, in turn, leads to the realization that we already <em class="calibre3">have</em> a global music, and always have.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-368" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Brain Harmony</p>
        <p class="ctx">According to one prevalent line of thought, the brain of the human fetus forms discrete configurations of synaptic circuits that are dedicated to specific tasks. By the time the fetus is a living child, there are several hundred of these configurations, called dedicated maps, which become strengthened or weakened according to what happens in the environment. Parts of certain maps have a correspondence to parts of others—these are called parallel groups. Sensory stimuli combined with internal signals trigger synaptic firings between parallel groups, providing coherence to the system and integrating the brain’s history.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-526" class="calibre12"></a><a href="#calibre_link-485" class="calibre12">*37</a></sup></p>
        <p class="calibre5">According to this model of layered, quasi-parallel maps, it is easy to see how music can influence the brain’s mapmaking faculty through the excitation of inherent neural patterns. Indeed, recent experiments show that neural tissues dedicated to sound are enlarged in the brains of musically trained children. These children score considerably higher on tests in subjects parallel to music, such as spatial and temporal reasoning. Such findings certainly corroborate the subjective experience of most musicians, that music forms the brain as the brain forms music. Good music grows good brain. This may shed light on the mystery of the affect of musical harmony: Music and the brain are both maps through time. Motion through the harmonic lattice-map as it folds and unfolds through time helps to organize in specific ways the stacks of maps in the brain. Music can thus be seen as a kind of projected exterior brain that helps to align the interior one, a map of a map that the brain uses to orient and direct itself. Composers construct this artificial brain painstakingly, coordinate by coordinate, and then, as it proves authentic, performers scroll through it over and over again to keep the interior brain healthy.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When you study the historical development of music, you can observe the brain directing itself by evolving maps it can use. It both guides and is guided by the exterior acoustic world. The music that survives from generation to generation is the music that nourishes the brain in ways that it most needs to feel healthy.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">In current brain research, sensory stimuli are presented to subjects whose brains are being monitored for blood flow, which is assumed to indicate brain activity, conscious or unconscious. We observe, in real time, specific sites in the brain as they are responding to specific stimuli: The brain map lights up. Exciting and promising as this is, neuroacoustics, a young and marginally funded science, has yet to ask certain central musical questions. What I would like to see with my own eyes are the neurological reactions to specific harmonic events. I want to see:</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li class="calibre13">What the brain looks like when it is hearing each of the singable tones of just intonation: 3:2, 5:4, 16:15, and so on. Is each one a discrete, observable state? That’s how it feels.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">How cross-rhythms, such as three against two, compare with their parallel frequency ratios. Do they involve parallel neural networks?</li>
          <li class="calibre13">What the brain looks like when harmony moves from overtonal to reciprocal, and specifically through the various quadrants of the five-limit lattice. Is there any topographical correlation between the two-dimensional lattice on the page and the three-dimensional lattice in the brain?</li>
          <li class="calibre13">How the brain tracks compounds. How does it locate the <em class="calibre3">one</em> that unifies sounding pitches? How does it know where the tonic is? Is the tonic somehow physically central?</li>
          <li class="calibre13">What happens during the navigation through a comma in just intonation.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">How the physical responses, if any, to low-prime ratios compare to the responses to their equal-tempered analogues.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">What happens during the breaking of a comma in equal temperament, when the lattice on the page folds and becomes flat again. Is there a playing out of the drama of Homebody and Pathfinder in the electron world of the brain?</li>
          <li class="calibre13">The behavior of neural activity during symmetric and atonal harmony.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="calibre5">Of course, I experience these musical events internally, both affectively and cognitively, and on that level I know what is true. So why this fascination with visually observing the brain? Because I want to catch music and the brain <em class="calibre3">in the act</em> of forming one another. I want to see under one more new lens how inseparable we are from music, how purely we and music are aspects of one another.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-369" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Music as a Model of Knowing</p>
        <p class="ctx">The brain isn’t the only thing music maps. It helps us understand the entire body: the skeleton and the muscles as well as the subtle body. Consider how we create and respond to rhythms and cross-rhythms—how deeply we groove in duple, triple, and compound meters. Now remember how the cross-rhythms of macrotime parallel the harmonic ratios of micro-time. We are familiar with the body that dances in macrotime, but what body responds to harmony? It is the neural, electric, etheric body. The way rhythm is a model for knowing the skeletal body, harmony is a model for knowing the subtle body. What you learn about your torso, arms, and legs when you play in rhythmic grooves and dance to them, you learn about your subtle body when you study harmony. You learn how enormously refined your sensibilities can become. You get small and you get fine.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">You also get large. When you open yourself to the elemental wave patterns of music, you sense their innate intelligence, and by striving to understand how they organize into music, you recognize music’s continuity with all forms, and the seamlessness from “dead” to “living.” Being is alive, and it is musical. Every octave sings.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">What I want most is for you to be able to connect what you are with what you hear so that there is no separation, no subject or object, only the state of mutuality between them. Music, especially the harmonic aspect of it, the “agreement” part, seems able to impart this way of knowing as a kind of effacement. When you know harmony, you see how it both is and is not you, and this generates a keen sense of inner authority and awakens wonder.</p>

      <div id="calibre_link-370" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">What Music Stands For</p>
        <p class="ctx">When we listen to music, we are in a special zone of meaning that carries forward to the meaning of life itself. The specialness of life is made more present. Timbres and inflections invoke aspects of the human voice and of nature’s voice. The undulations of melodies, the journeys to the harmonic quadrants, the rhythms, the textures, all combine to give a sense of displacement and return, a braided drama that serves as a sonic metaphor for real life. In this sense, music <em class="calibre3">stands for</em> real life. One can also say (I have said it) that music is self-contained, that it is itself only, and means itself only. Ultimately, however, nothing is itself only (with the exception of everything, of course).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">When we listen to music, our absorption can be so complete that it seems to come into us from every dimension, from everywhere, and we feel contained within a larger Self. As long as the music is playing, it gives us that feeling of wholeness. We leap into the wholeness. Making that leap is what music is for. But when the music stops, we are discovered in the middle of real life, and music is not life. Life is life. Life is the way you are feeling right now as you read these words. Life is the health of your family, and your love energy, and your need for sleep, and the season’s turning, and war and peace. Life can be lived musically, but what we call music is only a part of life that reflects and illumines it in a special way. When life is at its most intense—sudden danger, ecstatic orgasm, blind rage—there is no room or need for music. In the movies, yes. But in the real world, the music stops and life fills the sphere.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">A metaphor is a transfer of sensibility from one realm to another. Consider, then, these realms that the music metaphor bridges:</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li class="calibre13">The resonances of just intonation stand for low-prime number relationships, thereby representing the pure realm of number in the sound world.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">The approximations of equal temperament stand for the resonances of just intonation, bringing the harmonic verities into a highly flexible system.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">Harmonic journeys through the lattice stand for real-life journeys. The tonic is our feet on the ground, while love- and soul-hungers sweep us off our feet and back again in endless configurations.</li>
          <li class="calibre13">The wholeness of music stands for the whole of life, each piece a birth and a death, a piece of one-ness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="calibre5">Can we go farther than this? Does a person’s life <em class="calibre3">stand for</em> something? Take the case of an isolated mystic. He has been praying in a mountain cave for sixty years. There are two explanations: (1) This is a disturbed individual, whom it takes sixty years of prayer to calm down. (2) This individual is dedicated to manifesting a sphere of protection around the planet by means of maximal refinement of his sensibilities. By the latter reckoning, one’s life can stand for many. This leads to the image of the artist as the champion of humanity—Beethoven as the loner-savior, Bach as the composer-saint. But wait! We’re going too far. We’ve been talking all night, and we’ve passed all the signs and left the road. The crickets are silent, the clock is ticking, and what of our promise to play brilliantly in all twelve keys by morning?</p>

        <p class="calibre5">This book will prove useful in proportion to how completely it is transcended. The great thirteenth-century poet Jelaluddin Rumi lived the normal life of a religious scholar until the age of thirty-seven, when, through the agency of a wandering mystic, Shams of Tabriz, he underwent a period of ecstatic, connective experiences. As the story goes, Shams “took Rumi’s books, his intellectual brilliance, and threw them into a well to show him how he needed to live what he’d been reading.”<sup class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-527" class="calibre12"></a><a href="#calibre_link-486" class="calibre12">*38</a></sup> Then his teacher disappeared, and Rumi became a master poet and musician, singing and whirling by the hour.</p>

      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">bass:</b> the lowest sounding tone; not to be confused with the root (of a chord), which may or may not be the bass.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">bicyclic:</b> a coined term referring to harmonic sequences that alternate back and forth between two configurations.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">blu:</em></b> the syllable used to identify the minor seventh derived from the seventh partial, 7:4.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">blu</em>-blooded:</b> compound tones whose ratios include seven as a factor.</p>

A cadence that proceeds from V to I is called perfect or authentic. A cadence that proceeds IV to V to I is called a whole cadence. A half cadence pauses on V; a plagal cadence progresses IV to I.

      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">harmony:</b> refers primarily, in this book, to events that can be quantified by ratio, as opposed to events that can be measured by interval.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">heptatonic:</b> containing seven tones.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">Homebody:</b> a characterization of the ear’s psychological desire to know and retain the generating tone of the harmony.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">interval:</b> a quantifier of the melodic distance between two tones, usually without specification as to their harmonic interaction, as distinct from ratio (<em class="calibre3">q.v.</em>).</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">just intonation:</b> in some texts, the five-limit system of tuning; in this book, any system of tuning using low primes.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">key:</b> the tonic; in general use, the word often includes a designation of mode: <em class="calibre3">the key of C Minor.</em> This book attempts to retain the distinction between key and mode <em class="calibre3">(q.v.)</em> whenever possible.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">key chain:</b> a progression of keys and modes used as a harmonic template for improvisation or composition.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">komal:</em></b> flat; <em class="calibre3">ati komal:</em> a little more flat (usually by a comma).</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">lattice:</b> a graphlike configuration where each axis is devoted to tones generated by a specific prime number; a two-dimensional lattice (i.e., on a page) is confined to a tuning system using two primes. A <em class="calibre3">lattice of tones</em> combines the graph principle with staff notation by skewing the direction of both axes. A <em class="calibre3">lattice of twelve notes</em> refers to the twelve most simply derived ratios; an <em class="calibre3">extended lattice</em> includes indefinitely more notes; a <em class="calibre3">chord lattice</em> abandons the staff notation and shows the major and minor triads by chord symbols only; in a <em class="calibre3">key lattice,</em> the symbols stand for keys.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">ma:</em></b> the fourth degree of the scale.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">Magic Mode:</b> an equal-tempered phenomenon according to which the twelve tones of an equal-tempered scale can refer unambiguously to twenty-eight tones on the five-limit lattice, depending on context. Also called the Omnimode.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">Magic Scale:</b> the tones of the Magic Mode arranged as a scale.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">major:</b> large; most narrowly, an adjective modifying a number, as in <em class="calibre3">major sixth.</em></p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">major/minor pair:</b> two forms of one degree that stand to each other as 25:24; for instance, in the key of C, the 5:4 major third and the 6:5 minor third. The four scale degrees that have major/minor pairs are the second, third, sixth, and seventh.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">major whole tone:</b> the 9:8 major second.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">matchstick harmony:</b> <em class="calibre3">see</em> continuous harmony.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">meend:</em></b> in Indian music, the sliding from resonance to resonance; the shaping of tones.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">melody:</b> refers in this book to the up-and-down aspect of music, that which is quantifiable by intervalic measurement; as distinct from harmony (<em class="calibre3">q.v.</em>).</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">minor:</b> small; most narrowly, an adjective modifying a number, as in minor third.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">minor whole tone:</b> 10:9.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">modality:</b> the quality of music within a mode. Most simply, the term refers to music that establishes clear choices of tones that relate to an unchanging tonic.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">modal modulation:</b> a change of tonic or mode or both, usually not driven by a conventional V to I cadence.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">mode:</b> a chosen set of tones, usually comprising five or seven functional degrees of a scale.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">modulation:</b> any convincing change of tonic; <em class="calibre3">see also</em> tonal modulation.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">ni:</em></b> the seventh degree of the scale.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">nonatonic:</b> containing nine tones.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">note:</b> the term is reserved for any tone <em class="calibre3">(q.v.)</em> that is related to notation. Generally, a tone sounds, a note is written, but the distinction is difficult to maintain.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">octatonic:</b> containing eight tones.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">octave reduction:</b> the transposition by octaves of intervals greater than an octave so that they lie within the compass of an octave; by octave reduction, a perfect twelfth becomes a perfect fifth, and a major seventeenth becomes a major third.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">Omnimode:</b> an alternative name for the Magic Mode.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">overtonal:</b> quantifiable by the overtone series or its compounds; in this book, the result of the multiplication of low primes; in contradistinction to reciprocal (<em class="calibre3">q.v.</em>).</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">overtone, overtone series:</b> <em class="calibre3">see</em> harmonic series.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">pa:</em></b> the fifth degree of the scale; as an adjective, <em class="calibre3">pa</em> refers to harmony generated by the ratio 3:2.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">pa</em> dimension:</b> the aspect of music generated by 3:2 fifths.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">parallel:</b> in counterpoint, parts moving in the same direction holding the same interval between them. Thus men and women singing the same melody an octave apart are said to be singing in parallel octaves. In harmony, the term refers to two modes with the same tonic but different tonal content. The parallel minor of C Major is C Minor; the parallel major of C Minor is C Major; as distinct from relative (<em class="calibre3">q.v.</em>).</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">partial:</b> either a generating tone or one of its harmonics <em class="calibre3">(q.v.).</em> The generating tone is the first partial; the doubling of its frequency is the second partial (although it is the first harmonic); the tripling of the generating tone is the third partial (although it is the second harmonic), and so on. Because the multiplicand of the generating tone and the number of the partial are identical, the term is useful in mathematical discussions.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">Pathfinder:</b> a characterization of the ear’s psychological desire to track its way cogently through the lattice of tonal harmony.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">pentamerous:</b> harmony generated by the prime number five, that is, harmony characterized by the presence of 5:4 major thirds and their compounds and reciprocals.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">pentatonic:</b> containing five tones.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">perfect:</b> the quality assigned to 1:1 primes, 3:2 fifths, 4:3 fourths, and all octave expansions of these intervals.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">ping-pong cadence:</b> a special configuration of a whole cadence intended to demonstrate its property of balance around a center.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">pitch:</b> the specific frequency of a tone; its precise tuning.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">pivot chord (or tone):</b> in modulation, a chord (or tone) that has one function in the old key and another in the new key.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">polar:</b> refers to the tendency of harmony, in its attraction to the central tone, to act in opposite directions. For example, in Pythagorean harmony, eastern (overtonal) harmony pulls westward back toward the center; western (reciprocal) harmony pulls eastward back toward the center. In pentamerous harmony, northern (overtonal) harmony pulls south; southern (reciprocal) harmony pulls north. Polarity thus refers to our sense of tension between opposites. A “polar flip in the <em class="calibre3">ga</em> dimension” refers to a sudden leap from north to south or vice versa, and its consequent reversal of pentamerous polarity.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">positional analysis:</b> the perception of tonal harmony as a series of positions or locations on a five-limit lattice, and the procedures and notations that consequently arise.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">prime number:</b> a positive whole number that has as factors only itself and unity.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">pure:</b> an interval with the lowest possible ratio. A pure prime is 1:1; a pure octave is 2:1; a pure fifth is 3:2; a pure fourth is 4:3; a pure major third is 5:4. Pure fifths and pure thirds are sometimes called “just fifths” and “just thirds.”</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">Pythagorean:</b> generally, having to do with the thought (or supposed thought) of Pythagoras. In this book, <em class="calibre3">Pythagorean</em> refers to a three-limit system, that is, a system confined to 2:1 octaves and 3:2 fifths, and their compounds and reciprocals.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">quadrisection (of an octave):</b> in equal temperament, the division of an octave into four equal parts.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">raga:</em></b> in Indian music, a collection of tones, specifically tuned and shaped to evoke a mood, used as the basis for extended composition and improvisation.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">ratio:</b> the relationship between one frequency and another; the quantifier of harmonic space, as distinct from interval, (<em class="calibre3">q.v.</em>).</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">re:</em></b> the second degree of the scale.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">reciprocal:</b> the opposite of overtonal; the term as used in this book draws from the mathematical meaning “inverse.” The reciprocal of the perfect fifth C up to G is thus the perfect fifth C down to F; the appropriate mathematical procedure is division instead of multiplication; the ratio of the upward fifth (3:2) is inverted to become its reciprocal (2:3). The concomitant adjective <em class="calibre3">reciprocity</em> conventionally implies mutuality, however, and is avoided here.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">reference norm:</b> in harmony, sensible low-prime ratios; metaphorically, specific locations on the lattice of just tones, which is a template of reference norms.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">relative:</b> conventionally, C Major is the relative Major of A Minor; A Minor is the relative Minor of C Major. But in a wider definition, any two modes sharing the same tonal content are said to be relative.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">resonance:</b> the conventional definition is the reinforcement of tones by synchronous or near-related vibration; as used in this book, the term refers to sensible (that is, singable) combinations of tones related by low-prime ratios.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">root:</b> the letter name of a chord, as distinct from both bass and tonic <em class="calibre3">(q.v.)</em>.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">sa:</em></b> the tonic of a key or mode.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">sargam:</em></b> in Indian music, the names of the degrees of the scale, specifically, <em class="calibre3">sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha,</em> and <em class="calibre3">ni,</em> abbreviated <em class="calibre3">s, r, g, m, p, d,</em> and <em class="calibre3">n.</em></p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">scale:</b> the incrementally ascending or descending arrangement of the notes of a mode, or any set of tones. <em class="calibre3">Scalar</em> is the adjective.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">secondary dominant:</b> a major triad whose root is a fifth above that of any primary triad in a key (except the tonic triad).</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">septimal:</b> involving the seventh partial.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">sequence:</b> a brief series of tones (melodic) or chords (harmonic) that repeats according to an intervalic pattern that is either diatonic or cyclic.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">set:</b> in music, a chosen group or collection of tones.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">sextatonic:</b> containing six tones.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">solfege:</b> any system of naming tones according to their scale degrees or letter names, usually by means of a system of phonemes. Generally used while singing.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">spine of fifths, of thirds:</b> on the lattice of tones, the <em class="calibre3">x</em> axis comprises tones separated by fifths and is called the central spine of fifths; the <em class="calibre3">y</em> axis is called the central spine of thirds. For the configuration of other spines of fifths and thirds see example 16.20, page 123.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">staff orientation:</b> the configuration of tones and chords that arises from the five-limit lattice of tones as portrayed on musical staves; as distinct from compass orientation (<em class="calibre3">q.v.</em>).</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">subdominant:</b> the perfect fifth below the tonic.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">symmetrical harmony:</b> in equal temperament, harmony based on regularly recurring intervalic patterns; as distinct from harmonic symmetry (<em class="calibre3">q.v.</em>).</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">temperament:</b> a method of tuning that defines a closed system of a finite set of tones (such as twelve), some or all of which are tuned in a prescribed deviation from their pure ratios (in contradistinction to just intonation, <em class="calibre3">q.v.</em>). In equal temperament <em class="calibre3">(q.v.)</em> all tones except the octave are tuned impure.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">tempered (of an interval):</b> intentionally tuned impure. Thus in twelve-tone equal temperament <em class="calibre3">(q.v.)</em> the major third is tempered fourteen cents wide of the 5:4 pure major third.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">tetrachord:</b> in this book, four consecutive tones of a heptatonic scale. Thus, in C Major, the lower tetrachord is C, D, E, and F; the upper tetrachord is G, A, B, and the octave C.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8"><em class="calibre3">tivra:</em></b> sharp.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">tonal harmony:</b> generally refers to modulating harmony with identifiable tonics. A more narrow definition refers to the dominant-seventh-driven harmony of the common practice period.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">tonal modulation:</b> the process of changing tonics in tonal harmony <em class="calibre3">(q.v.).</em></p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">tone:</b> any sustained, sensible frequency, but not necessarily octave-specific. For instance, “the tone C<span class="fon">#</span>” means any C<span class="fon">#</span>, or a certain C<span class="fon">#</span>, depending on context. “The note <em class="calibre3">(q.v.)</em> C<span class="fon">#</span>” refers (as much as possible) to one that is notated; <em class="calibre3">see also</em> pitch.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">tonic:</b> the generating tone, or key note, or home note of a piece.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">tonicization:</b> the temporary—often fleeting—establishment of a tonic.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">tricyclic:</b> a coined term referring to harmonic sequences that progress regularly through three configurations.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">unambiguous harmony:</b> any tones whose position on the lattice of just tones is discrete.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">variable-pitch instruments:</b> instruments whose tunings can be adjusted during the act of playing.</p>
      <p class="bibtx"><b class="calibre8">virtual return:</b> the return to a tonic distant by one or more commas from the original tonic.</p>

      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-392"><a href="#calibre_link-490">*1</a> Passages from <em class="calibre3">The Musical Life: What It Is and How 
to Live It</em> (W. A. Mathieu, © 1994) and <em class="calibre3">The Listening Book: Discovering 
Your Own Music</em> (W. A. Mathieu, © 1991) are reprinted by arrangement with 
Shambhala Publications, Inc., Boston.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 5</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-394"><a href="#calibre_link-491">*2</a> Kepler is cited in <em class="calibre3">Tone: A Study in Musical 
Acoustics</em> by Sigmund Levarie and Ernst Levy (Kent, OH: Kent State Univ. 
Press, 1968), who translated the passage from the German.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 6</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-396"><a href="#calibre_link-492">*3</a> Quoted in Levarie and Levy, <em class="calibre3">Tone: A Study in Musical Acoustics</em>.</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-397"><a href="#calibre_link-493">*4</a> The retroflexive <em class="calibre3">r</em> can be approximated by 
pronouncing, in a British accent, “very, very rich” and noticing how the tongue 
curls up and backward slightly to expose the underside of the tip to the back of 
the front teeth. The retroflexive <em class="calibre3">r</em> is something like a softened <em class="calibre3">d</em>, 
and totally avoids the pursing of the lips, thereby leaving the vowel open from 
the onset of the tone.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 7</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-399"><a href="#calibre_link-494">*5</a> Reciprocal tones have been termed by some theorists “undertonal” or, by Harry Partch, 
“U-tonal.” It seems to me, however, that “under” is a less complete idea than 
reciprocal, and also slightly misleading, since the tones are not actually 
produced audibly below the generating tone in the same way that overtones are 
produced above it. A more likely choice is <em class="calibre3">inversional,</em> which I used for 
a while, but it is a term too easily confused with the inversions of chords. <em class="calibre3">
Reciprocal</em> wins.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 9</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-402"><a href="#calibre_link-495">*6</a> One could argue for “<em class="calibre3">ma</em> of <em class="calibre3">ga</em>” as a more 
accurate name, but it will soon become clear that <em class="calibre3">pa</em> is a better term for 
describing all 3:2 relationships, both overtonal and reciprocal.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 10</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-404"><a href="#calibre_link-496">*7</a> Three of the first and six of the second.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 11</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-407"><a href="#calibre_link-497">*8</a> Although Alain Daniélou hinted at this new definition 
in 1943 in <em class="calibre3">Introduction to the Study of Musical Scales</em> (now known as <em class="calibre3">
Music and the Power of Sound</em>—see list of sources), I think it was first 
spelled out in print in a 1962 report titled <em class="calibre3">Organization in Auditory 
Perception</em> by Boomsliter and Creel. Reading the report in 1972 was a 
thrilling moment of corroboration for me: I had come to the same conclusion 
entirely as a musician, and here before me was the scientific quantification. It 
was a good demonstration of how concepts are realized as they are needed not by 
an individual but as a collective tendency.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 12</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-409"><a href="#calibre_link-498">*9</a> Was there ever a tetrachord begging for a better name?</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 13</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-411"><a href="#calibre_link-499">*10</a> A few great singers who use vibrato exquisitely: Billie Holliday, Emma Kirkby, 
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 14</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-413"><a href="#calibre_link-500">*11</a> I would not be startled to learn that, unbeknownst to me, such a scheme has already been devised.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 20</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-421"><a href="#calibre_link-501">*12</a> Remember from chapter 1 
that a theoretically perfect string would not only vibrate along its entire 
length but also divide into halves, thirds, quarters, and so on, each division 
making its own sine wave and producing its own partial. In reality, stiffness at 
the bridge and nut inhibits the ends of the string from vibrating freely and 
throws off the precision of the divisions. The greater the string tension, the 
greater the inharmonicity of the overtones. On most stringed instruments the 
tension is so low as to make the deviation negligible; on the piano, however, 
the sharpness of the overtones is quite apparent. Piano tuners use various 
tricks, including “stretching” octaves, to compensate for the string’s innate 
out-of-tuneness.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 21</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-423"><a href="#calibre_link-502">*13</a> As has been discussed in chapter 16, the D to C in C Major is 9:8; in A Aeolian it is 10:9, 
one of the subtle distinctions disguised by equal temperament.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 22</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-425"><a href="#calibre_link-503">*14</a> The subject of harmonic balance is developed variously 
throughout the book; see especially chapter 38.</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-426"><a href="#calibre_link-504">†15</a> Twelve-step programs have developed nationally to support composers who want to 
wean themselves from overdependency on reciprocal energy. There is probably a 
Flats Anonymous nearby in your city or town. A countermovement has also arisen, 
however, and its most recent publication, <em class="calibre3">Nurturing the Double Flat Within,</em> 
is available upon request.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 23</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-428"><a href="#calibre_link-505">*16</a> The question of how we hear equal-tempered seven-tone modes without a drone is addressed in part 3.</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-429"><a href="#calibre_link-506">*17</a> To intensify the harmonic functions 
in example 23.22, as well as in similar triads-over-drone examples in this 
chapter, it may be quite helpful to temporarily abandon the drone in the left 
hand and play the chord roots instead.</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-430"><a href="#calibre_link-507">*18</a> I find it remarkable—heartwarming, actually—to notice that this reversal of cadential 
energy, this flip of polarity from yang to yin, was synchronous with a time of 
renewed social conscience and spiritual reawakening. It has often been claimed 
that the musicians of a culture signal the quality of its approaching era, and 
the sudden emergence of the Mixolydian cadence at a time when a new bright star 
of Western receptivity was beginning to rise lends credence to that claim.</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-431"><a href="#calibre_link-508">*19</a> It’s possible, from the purely Pythagorean standpoint, and focusing on the key signatures alone, to draw a parallel between the progression of modes from 
Lydian to Phrygian and the progression of Major keys around the circle of fifths 
from G Major to A<span class="fon">b</span> Major. 
This may be a highly practical mental construct, since in European music our 
prominent reference is the Major mode. But to think of the rich variety of these 
modes simply as a kind of transposed Major mode is, as I hope we have seen, a 
limited construct indeed.</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-432"><a href="#calibre_link-509">†20</a> I could make a weak case for the 
existence of B<span class="fon">b</span> minor as 
the minor dominant of the relative major (v/III), but I won’t.</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 24</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-434"><a href="#calibre_link-510">*21</a> In equal temperament, the ear will not allow the 
central spine of fifths to extend unless it is continuous—no gaps. A gap will 
snap the Pythagorean spine. Tones that might have appeared beyond a gap are 
readily appropriated for <em class="calibre3">ga-</em>blooded 
purposes. This is further discussed at the end of this chapter.</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-435"><a href="#calibre_link-511">*22</a> Because the overtonal and reciprocal pentamerous energies are mixed: See 
chapter 12.</p>

      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-438"><a href="#calibre_link-512">*23</a> An optional name is the 
“Omnimode.”</p>
      <p class="ntx">CHAPTER 32</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-448"><a href="#calibre_link-513">*24</a> Even though I have 
relented in the case of “<span class="fon">b</span>VI,” 
I cannot bring myself to use the conventional “<span class="fon">#</span>6” 
sign when there is no actual sharp in the spelling.</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-450"><a href="#calibre_link-514">*25</a> Ordinarily the augmented sixth chord built from the <span class="fon">b</span>VII—B<span class="fon">b</span><span class="fon">#</span><sup class="calibre19">6</sup> in the key of C—proceeds via A<sup class="calibre19">7</sup> to D minor, which functions, at least 
when first heard, as the relative minor of the subdominant. That would occur if 
the F<span class="fon">#</span> in the soprano of bar 4 
were F<span class="fon">n</span> for the entire bar; 
if this were the case, the comma between A<span class="fon">b</span> 
and G<span class="fon">#</span> would be the Great 
Diesis, not the diaschisma. Notice that the two target D’s in question (the V/V, 
9:8, as opposed to the vi/IV, 10:9) are positioned a Didymic comma from one 
another. Does this mean that the difference between the diaschisma, which is 
evoked in the first case, and the Great Diesis which is evoked in the second 
case, is a Didymic comma? The answer—both conceptually delightful and musically 
obscure—is yes.</p>
      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-451"><a href="#calibre_link-515">*26</a> The unique case of a cadential <em class="calibre3">ga-ga</em>-below 
diaschismic pair of <em class="calibre3">triads</em> (E<span class="fon">º</span>/D) will be demonstrated in chapter 38.</p>

      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-453"><a href="#calibre_link-516">*27</a> I say “suggest” because we associate these voicings with the jazz style; would the same harmonies heard by Bach in 1730 have suggested septimal harmony to him? 
Unlikely. What <em class="calibre3">would</em> equal-tempered keyboard jazz have sounded like to Bach? Lukewarm, I think, though I’ll bet he 
would have been deeply drawn to the tonal nuances of the singers and players of variable pitch instruments.</p>

whole-tone scale and the other scales examined in this chapter “modes of limited 
transposition.” Unlike the usual diatonic scales, these scales cannot be 
transposed to twelve different tonal centers without repeating themselves. For 
instance, when either form of the whole-tone scale is transposed up or down a 
whole step, major third, or tritone, the resulting set is the same collection of 
tones—nothing changes. Experimentation with the other scales in this chapter 
will reveal which transpositions are redundant with the original scale. <em class="calibre3">Ed.</em></p>

      <p class="ntstx" id="calibre_link-481"><a href="#calibre_link-524">*35</a> In example 43.11, notice that (a) each scale ascends as it moves to the right; (b) the scales are in order of increasing reciprocity as they move down the page; and (c) the broken lines all slant to the right downward. This means that the pitches of the comma siblings <em class="calibre3">rise</em> as they move downward toward increasingly reciprocal territory. Indeed, it may be generally said that a reciprocally positioned comma sibling is higher in pitch than its overtonal partner. This turns out to be more or less true for all comma siblings involving <em class="calibre3">ga</em> or <em class="calibre3">blu</em> blood. The single exception is the purely <em class="calibre3">pa</em>-blooded Pythagorean comma: The generating C is <em class="calibre3">lower</em> than the B<span class="fon">#</span> twelve fifths distant; but remember that the Pythagorean comma is rarely invoked in actual music in real time. So (save for the Pythagorean exception) the practical musician’s guideline is: The pitch of comma siblings rises as you travel south on the lattice and falls as you travel north.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="ctx1">What follows is not a proper bibliography or discography, but a recognition of some of the primary sources I have used for learning harmony and for writing this book. First, allow me to list my own books, which I had to write before writing this one.</p>
        <p class="bibtxt"><em class="calibre3">The Listening Book: Discovering Your Own Music.</em> Boston: Shambhala, 1991. This book for the general reader is meant to transform awareness of everyday sound into musical practice. It suggests ways to clarify the process of music practice and shows how to structure improvisatory practice.</p>
        <p class="bibtx"><em class="calibre3">The Musical Life: What It Is and How to Live It.</em> Boston: Shambhala, 1994. Brief essays discuss the relation between psyche and muse. The book also contains a seventy-page section called “Sound Is the Teacher,” which treats the overtone series experientially from its elemental nature to its larger harmonic meaning, and is recommended for readers of this book not familiar with the subject.</p>
        <p class="csht1">HARMONIC THEORY</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Blackwood, Easley. <em class="calibre3">The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings</em>. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1985. An elegant alliance between perception (what is “recognizable”) and number (its mathematical quantification). The book is essentially for theorists (and musicians) who are functional in algebra at the college level, which I am not, so I can follow it only so far. But what I do understand, including the tables and the gist of the text, has been of immense value in forming my own set of alliances.</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Boomsliter, Paul, and Warren Creel. “Organization in Auditory Perception.” An unpublished paper that may be available through some university libraries. It is the product of the authors’ collaboration at the State University College in Albany, New York, in 1962; I first saw a photocopy of the manuscript in 1972. The authors were the first, I think, to intuit the physiology of the modal roots of modulating tonality. Specifically, they addressed the intricacies of compounding, which they called “extended reference”; they also articulated the pentamerous polarity between relative and parallel realms. They were pioneers, and their work, greatly admired by those who have benefited from it, is largely unrecognized.</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Daniélou, Alain. <em class="calibre3">Music and the Power of Sound: The Influence of Tuning and Interval on Consciousness.</em> Rev. ed. Rochester, VT: Inner Traditions, 1995. First published as <em class="calibre3">Introduction to the Study of Musical Scales</em> in 1943, this is a brilliant, though biased, book. Brilliant because the author understood the universality of the harmonic generation of scales; biased because he dismissed equal temperament as a mistaken aberration leading only to decadence. Nevertheless, his book is wide in scope and thought-provoking.</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Doty, David B. <em class="calibre3">The Just Intonation Primer.</em> 1993. Probably the most practical guide available for learning the subject. The text is clear, including explication of the math, and the definitions are precise. There are lattices (not in staff notation) and various other harmonic diagrams, ample discussion of higher primes, and a good discussion of just intonation played on “real instruments.” The book is available through the Just Intonation Network, an organization of musicians devoted to the field; their address is 535 Stevenson Street, San Francisco, CA 94103.</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Helmholtz, Hermann. <em class="calibre3">On the Sensation of Tone.</em> Translated by Alexander Ellis. Reprint. New York: Dover, 1954. Originally published in 1863 as <em class="calibre3">On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music,</em> and translated into English by Ellis in 1885. It endures not only as a seminal work but also as a most useful reference. Ellis made invaluable contributions in an appendix of 120 pages. He was the first, I believe, and possibly the most articulate, in describing the lattice of twelve notes, which he named the <em class="calibre3">harmonic duodene,</em> or the unit of modulation (on p. 461), although he did not use staff notation. The extended lattice he named the Duodenarium (p. 463). These concepts led eventually to present-day harmonic theory, including my own thinking.</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Jorgensen, Owen. <em class="calibre3">Tuning: The Perfection of Eighteenth-Century Temperament, The Lost Art of Nineteenth-Century Temperament, and the Science of Equal Temperament.</em> East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1991. This book will tell you everything about the development of temperament that <em class="calibre3">Harmonic Experience</em> leaves out. Historically organized into 223 brief chapters, the text is clear, passionate, and wonderfully replete. Interspersed with liberal quotations from original sources are careful instructions for the tuning of each temperament discussed. Precise equal-tempered tuning was not fully accepted until the early twentieth century, and this volume gives a vivid picture of the dramatic transformations in musician’s perceptions and tuner’s craft that occurred along the way.</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Levarie, Seigmund, and Ernst Levy. <em class="calibre3">Tone: A Study in Musical Acoustics.</em> Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1968. Like Ernst Levy’s <em class="calibre3">A Theory of Harmony</em>, (Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1985), this is a theoretical precursor to the present book, and I am indebted to the authors for many of their ideas. Although I disagree with much of their theory, they never lose sight of the interface between inner and outer worlds. Both books should be read by students interested in the development of contemporary music theory.</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Makeig, Scott. “Affective versus Analytic Perception of Musical Intervals.” In <em class="calibre3">Music, Mind, and Brain: The Neuropsychology of Music,</em> edited by Manfred Clynes. New York: Plenum Press, 1982. Makeig discusses “how the affective experience of tonal harmonies is linked to their objective structure”; he shows that harmony is highly structured by the compounding of small-integer frequency ratios according to “a small number of principles, and may be modelled spatially.”</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Partch, Harry. <em class="calibre3">Genesis of a Music.</em> 1949. Reprint. New York: Da Capo Press, 1974. A touchstone for musicians interested in eleven-limit just systems (especially Partch’s), it has also become a primary reference as an overview of the subject of tuning, including synopses of the major contributions to the field. It is written with a cantankerous and engaging wit and, at least as much as Partch’s music, keeps his creative spirit alive.</p>
        <p class="csht1">ACOUSTICS</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Benade, Arthur H. <em class="calibre3">Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics</em>. New York: Oxford University Press, 1976. The best college-level acoustics text I’ve seen.</p>

If you want to perceive tonal harmony the way it was perceived by the Europeans who developed it, this volume is an open window.

It tells the hard truth in a warm way readers can use, discussing the monsters of failure, annihilation, pretending, academia, and money with clear eyes and direct language, and is especially appropriate for composers.</p>
        <p class="bibtx">Dewey, John. <em class="calibre3">Art as Experience.</em> (Berkeley, CA: Berkeley Publications, 1959). Dewey develops a view of aesthetics on a vector between the subjective and the objective in art.

        <p class="bibtx">Khan, Hazrat Inayat. <em class="calibre3">The Mysticism of Sound.</em> Available in many editions under various titles, including <em class="calibre3">The Music of Life</em> (New Lebanon, NY: Omega Press, 1983), and most recently as <em class="calibre3">The Mysticism of Sound and Music</em> (Boston: Shambhala, 1996). Inayat Khan (1885–1927), in addition to being one of the great writers on spirituality, was also highly trained in North Indian music. He is the only holy man I know of who has articulated an authentic and inclusive spiritual message from the sensibilities of a master musician.</p>

          <b class="calibre8">Recordings</b>
        </p>
        <p class="csht1">EARLY EUROPEAN MUSIC</p>
        <p class="ctx2">Although there are a good number of excellent recordings of early European music, my purpose here is to list only a few that I have found most especially in tune, musical, and informative. Following are three groups that bring forward early sensibilities to an extraordinary degree.</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li class="calibre10">Sequentia, a group of three Americans living in Cologne, are especially empathetic to the medieval aesthetic and have recorded a considerable repertoire of medieval music (on Deutsche Harmonia Mundi), including the works of Hildegard von Bingen.</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Ensemble PAN (Project Ars Nova), a Boston-based consortium of virtuoso singers and instrumentalists, specialize in fourteenth-century polyphony, including Machaut, Landini, and Ciconia, which they perform with profoundly affective intonation and ideal musicianship. Their recordings are on New Albion.</li>
          <li class="calibre10">Ensemble Alcatraz, a San Francisco-based group specializing in medieval and early renaissance music, performs in perfect tune and with sensational verve, and has two recordings on Elektra/Nonesuch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="csht1">WORLD MUSIC</p>
        <p class="ctx">There are so many recordings that testify to the vitality of music from around the globe that in order to familiarize yourself with the best without spending too much time and money you have to adopt a creative selection strategy. You could stand in front of the bins of a large record store and choose albums by intuition. You could seek out the discographies of books on relevant subjects. You could consult a reference that lists titles by country. You could keep your eye out for reviews (though that is risky). You could purchase a few collections of world music and proceed from there (a few are listed below). Perhaps the best method is to ask the advice of musicians whose taste you trust. I will list only a few recordings that have illuminated or amazed me, or influenced my compositional ear.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Perhaps the most astonishing music in the universe is produced collectively (and largely improvisationally) as a function of daily life by various tribes of Pygmies in central Africa. The music is modal, richly polyrhythmic and contrapuntal, and deeply joyous. One of the oldest and best collections is <em class="calibre3">Music of the Rain Forest Pygmies,</em> recorded in 1961 in the Ituri rain forest of Zaire by Colin M. Turnbull, and recently rereleased on Lyrichord (LYRCD 7157). A recent collection by Louis Sarno, Bayaka: <em class="calibre3">The Extraordinary Music of the Babenzele Pygmies</em> (Ellipsis Arts, 1995), contains a CD and a book by Sarno, who currently lives with the Babenzele in a resettled village he helped to found. Another release by Ellipsis Arts, <em class="calibre3">Echoes of the Forest,</em> contains music from both the Sarno and the Turnbull archives and comes with a smaller book including a good discography and bibliography.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Ellipsis Arts has released a number of collections that present various aspects of global music, among them <em class="calibre3">Voices of Forgotten Worlds</em> (an excellent two-disc compendium of vocal music), <em class="calibre3">Global Celebration</em> (music from festivals and celebratory rituals), <em class="calibre3">Planet Soup</em> (market-oriented cross-cultural collaborations) and, through their related firm, the Relaxation Company, <em class="calibre3">Global Meditation</em> (the music of sacred rituals).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">Of special interest to those who want to hear the overtone series produced vocally with astonishing clarity is <em class="calibre3">Tuva: Voices from the Center of Asia</em> (Smithsonian/Folkways 40017).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">The various Bulgarian state women’s choirs have come into world prominence over the last two decades singing music that is elegantly composed (or arranged) but that arises from an ancient vocal style and technique. The music is not only powerfully moving but also possibly the most perfect demonstration of the relationship between ancient sensibilities and modern composition, and it presents the ideal in modal modulation: vibrantly in-tune singing throughout an extended harmonic lattice. Representative recordings are <em class="calibre3">Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares</em> (2 vols., Nonesuch/Explorer) and those of any choir conducted by Philip Koutev.</p>
        <p class="calibre5">I will mention a few individual musicians. Hamza El-Din is a master troubadour, singing and playing (on oud) the songs of his Nubian homeland, long ago swallowed by the Aswan Dam. His music has been filtered through Asian, Middle Eastern, and European influences, and his tunings, impeccably just, are heavily accented with Arabic quarter tones. Any album is recommended; my current favorites are <em class="calibre3">Eclipse</em> (Ryko 0103) and <em class="calibre3">A Wish</em> (Sounds True).</p>
        <p class="calibre5">If you have not investigated North Indian music you might begin with any recording by Pandit Pran Nath (voice), Ram Narayan (sarangi), and Lakshmi Shankar (voice).</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-378" class="calibre1">
        <p class="csht">Contemporary Composition</p>
        <p class="ctx">Contemporary concert music is extremely diverse in style and intention, which seems to be a healthy state of affairs. I will not list my preferences, except to say that I think the works of Ben Johnston and Terry Riley are among the most intelligent and resonant of these times.</p>
